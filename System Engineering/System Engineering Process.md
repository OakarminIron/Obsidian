Systems engineering processes encompass all creative, manual and technical activities necessary to define the product and which need to be carried out to convert a system definition to a sufficiently detailed system design specification for product manufacture and deployment. Design and development of a system can be divided into four stages, each with different definitions
-   task definition (informative definition),
-   conceptual stage (cardinal definition),
-   design stage (formative definition), and
-   implementation stage (manufacturing definition).
