### Logical and Physical Address Space:

**Logical Address space:** An address generated by the CPU is known as a “Logical Address”. It is also known as a Virtual address. Logical address space can be defined as the size of the process. A logical address can be changed.

**Physical Address space:** An address seen by the memory unit (i.e the one loaded into the memory address register of the memory) is commonly known as a “Physical Address”. A Physical address is also known as a Real address. The set of all physical addresses corresponding to these logical addresses is known as Physical address space. A physical address is computed by MMU. The run-time mapping from virtual to physical addresses is done by a hardware device Memory Management Unit(MMU). The physical address always remains constant.

### Static and Dynamic Loading:

To load a process into the main memory is done by a loader. There are two different types of loading :

-   **Static loading**:- loading the entire program into a fixed address. It requires more memory space.
-   **Dynamic loading**:- The entire program and all data of a process must be in physical memory for the process to execute. So, the size of a process is limited to the size of physical memory. To gain proper memory utilization, dynamic loading is used. In dynamic loading, a routine is not loaded until it is called. All routines are residing on disk in a relocatable load format. One of the advantages of dynamic loading is that unused routine is never loaded. This loading is useful when a large amount of code is needed to handle it efficiently.

###  Static and Dynamic linking:

To perform a linking task a linker is used. A linker is a program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable file.

-   **Static linking:** In static linking, the linker combines all necessary program modules into a single executable program. So there is no runtime dependency. Some operating systems support only static linking, in which system language libraries are treated like any other object module.
-   **Dynamic linking:** The basic concept of dynamic linking is similar to dynamic loading. In dynamic linking, “Stub” is included for each appropriate library routine reference. A stub is a small piece of code. When the stub is executed, it checks whether the needed routine is already in memory or not. If not available then the program loads the routine into memory.
