Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6).
• Example: ap-southeast-2a, ap-southeast-2b, ap-southeast-2c
• Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
• They're separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters
• They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.
