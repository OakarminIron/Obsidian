Two critical concepts in the field of IT disaster recovery and business continuity planning. 
They help organizations define and measure their ability to recover data and systems in the event of a disruption.

Recovery Point Objective ([[DR RPO]]) It determines how much data can be lost during the recovery process.
Recovery Time Objective  ([[DR RTO]]) It specifies the time it takes to get systems and processes back to normal operation.
