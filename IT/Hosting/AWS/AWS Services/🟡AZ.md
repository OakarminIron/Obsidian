Availability Zones
Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6).
â€¢ Example: `ap-southeast-2a`,` ap-southeast-2b`, `ap-southeast-2c`
â€¢ Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centres with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
â€¢ They're separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters
â€¢ They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.
