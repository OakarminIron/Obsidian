• Amazon `S3` allows people to store objects in "buckets"
• Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
• Buckets are defined at the region level
• `S3` looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
• `S3` is private by default
• Bucket can't be encrypt but object can on service side (SSE-C) or client side (SSE-S3)

Amazon `S3` overview – Objects
• Objects (files) have a key
• The key is the full path: example.` S3://my-bucket/myfile.txt`
• The key is composed of prefix + object name . `Eg: s3://mybucket/myfolder/myfile.txt`
• There is no concept of "directories" within buckets
• Just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("/")
• Object versioning 

[[🟡S3 Replication]]
[[S3 Sync]]
[[S3 Websites]]
	• `S3` can host static websites and have them accessible on the `www`
	• If you get a 403 (Forbidden) error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads.

[[S3 Access Logs]]
• For audit purpose, may you want to log all access to `S3` buckets
• Any request made to `S3`, from any account, authorised, or denied will log to `S3` bucket
• That data can be analysed using data analysis tools
