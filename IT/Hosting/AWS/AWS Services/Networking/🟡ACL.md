AÂ _network access control list (`ACL`)_Â allows or denies specific inbound or outbound traffic at the `subnet` level. 
You can use the default network `ACL` for your `VPC`, or you can create a custom network `ACL` for your `VPC` with rules that are similar to the rules for your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your `VPC`.

Compare with [[ðŸŸ¡IAM Groups]]
