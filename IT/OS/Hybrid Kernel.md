[[Windows NT Kernel ]]

[[Apple XNU Kernel]]

-   Faster development time for drivers that can operate from within modules. No reboot required for testing (provided the kernel is not destabilized).
-   On demand capability versus spending time recompiling a whole kernel for things like new drivers or subsystems.
-   Faster integration of third party technology (related to development but pertinent unto itself nonetheless).
