A [[Hypervisor]] (also known as a **virtual machine monitor**, **VMM**, or **virtualizer**) is a type of computer software, firmwareor hardwarethat creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a _host machine_, and each virtual machine is called a _guest machine_. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Unlike an emulator, the guest executes most instructions on the native hardware. Multiple instances of a variety of operating systems may share the virtualized hardware resources: for example,
