The process of determining what actions or resources a user, system, or entity is allowed to access after their identity has been authenticated.
It defines the level of access and control a user has over resources within a system. 
Authorisation is based on the principle of granting appropriate permissions to users according to their roles, responsibilities, or the tasks they need to perform.
Authorisation is usually managed through roles, permissions, and  [[ACL(Access Control List)]].
Different levels of authorisation can be assigned, such as read-only access, read-write access, administrative access, etc.
