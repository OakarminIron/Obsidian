`SSO` is indeed a concept that enables users to access multiple applications or systems with just one set of credentials, such as a username and password. 

When using `SSO`, a user logs in to a Central [[Identity Provider (IdP)]] service once. 
This identity provider then issues a **token** that the user can present to other applications or services they want to access. 
This token serves as proof of authentication, and the applications trust the identity provider's token, allowing the user to gain access without needing to re-enter their credentials.
