Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity trying to access a resource or system.
It ensures that the user is who they claim to be. 
The primary goal of authentication is to confirm the identity of the user before allowing access to protected resources.
Methods of authentication include:

Something you know: Passwords, PINs, or security questions.
Something you have: Security tokens, smart cards, or mobile devices.
Something you are: Biometric traits like fingerprints, retina scans, or facial recognition.

In essence, authentication answers the question, "Who are you?" It establishes a user's identity before proceeding with any further actions.
