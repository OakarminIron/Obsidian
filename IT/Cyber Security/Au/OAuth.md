Open Authorisation is an open standard protocol that allows third-party applications to access a user's resources (e.g., data) on a resource owner's behalf without exposing the user's credentials. 
It's commonly used for enabling secure and controlled access to [[APIðŸš¡]], allowing users to grant specific permissions to third-party services without sharing their passwords. `OAuth` uses tokens to manage access.
