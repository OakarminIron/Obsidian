To perform a linking task a linker is used. A linker is a program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable file.

-   Static Linking
	- In static linking, the linker combines all necessary program modules into a single executable program. 
	- So there is no runtime dependency. Some operating systems support only static linking, in which system language libraries are treated like any other object module.
-   Dynamic Linking
	- The basic concept of dynamic linking is similar to dynamic loading. 
	- In dynamic linking, “Stub” is included for each appropriate library routine reference. 
		- A stub is a small piece of code. 
		- When the stub is executed, it checks whether the needed routine is already in memory or not. 
		- If not available then the program loads the routine into memory.
