- Physical Address Space 
	- The set of all physical addresses corresponding to these logical addresses is known as Physical address space. 
	- A physical address is computed by `MMU`. 
	- The run-time mapping from virtual to physical addresses is done by a hardware device Memory Management Unit(MMU).
	- The physical address always remains constant.

- Logical Address Space
	- An address generated by the CPU is known as a “Logical Address”. It is also known as a Virtual address. 
	- Logical address space can be defined as the size of the process. A logical address can be changed.

- Static Loading
	- Loading the entire program into a fixed address. 
	- The entire program and all data of a process must be in physical memory for the process to execute. 
	- So, the size of a process is limited to the size of physical memory.
	- It requires more memory space. 

- Dynamic Loading
	- To gain proper memory utilization, dynamic loading is used.
	- In dynamic loading, a routine is not loaded until it is called. 
	- All routines are residing on disk in a relocatable load format. 
	- One of the advantages of dynamic loading is that unused routine is never loaded. 
	- This loading is useful when a large amount of code is needed to handle it efficiently.
