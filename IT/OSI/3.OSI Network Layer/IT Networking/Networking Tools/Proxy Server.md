A proxy server can operate at different layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, depending on the specific type of proxy and the functionality it provides.

A proxy server is a computer or network device that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server. It receives requests from clients, passes them on to the server, and then returns the server's response back to the client.

In the OSI model, the proxy server can operate at the following layers:

-  [[3.OSI Network Layer]] (Network Layer): A proxy server at this layer is sometimes referred to as a "packet-level" or "network-level" proxy. It operates at the network layer and is responsible for routing packets between client and server. A packet-level proxy can be used to bypass network restrictions, such as a firewall, or to mask the identity of the client.
    
-   [[4.OSI Transport Layer]] (Transport Layer): A proxy server at this layer is sometimes referred to as a "transport-level" proxy. It operates at the transport layer and is responsible for managing the connection between client and server. A transport-level proxy can be used to improve performance by caching frequently requested content, or to secure the connection between client and server by encrypting and decrypting data.
    
-   [[7.OSI Application Layer]] (Application Layer): A proxy server at this layer is sometimes referred to as an "application-level" or "HTTP proxy". It operates at the application layer and is responsible for managing the interaction between client and server at the level of individual messages or requests. An application-level proxy can be used to filter or modify the content of specific types of messages, or to perform tasks such as load balancing or content caching.
    

In summary, a proxy server can operate at different layers of the OSI model, depending on the specific type of proxy and the functionality it provides.
