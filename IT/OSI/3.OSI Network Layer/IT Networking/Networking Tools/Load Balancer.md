A load balancer is a network device that distributes incoming traffic across a group of servers to improve the performance and availability of applications. Load balancer operate at the network layer [[3.OSI Network Layer]] of the OSI model and are responsible for routing traffic to the appropriate server based on a configured set of rules.

In the OSI model, the load balancer sits between the client and the servers and acts as a middleman, distributing incoming traffic among the servers. When a client sends a request to the load balancer, it determines which server should handle the request based on the configured load balancing algorithm and sends the request to that server. The server processes the request and returns the response to the load balancer, which then passes it back to the client.

Load balancers can operate at different layers of the OSI model, depending on the type of load balancer and the functionality it provides. For example, a load balancer that operates at the transport layer [[4.OSI Transport Layer]] is responsible for managing the connection between the client and the server, while a load balancer that operates at the application layer [[7.OSI Application Layer]]) is responsible for managing the interaction between the client and the server at the level of individual messages or requests.

In summary, a load balancer is a network device that operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and is responsible for distributing incoming traffic among a group of servers to improve the performance and availability of applications.
