[[Object Storage]]
Block storage is a type of storage that is organized as a series of blocks, each of which can be read or written individually. It is typically used for applications that require low-latency, high-performance storage, such as databases or virtual machines.

File storage is a type of storage that organizes data as a hierarchy of files and directories. It is typically used for applications that require a more traditional file system interface, such as file servers or network-attached storage (NAS) devices.

Object storage is a type of storage that organizes data as a flat collection of objects, each of which is identified by a unique key. It is typically used for applications that require large-scale, salable storage, such as cloud storage or content delivery networks ([[üêøCDN]]).
