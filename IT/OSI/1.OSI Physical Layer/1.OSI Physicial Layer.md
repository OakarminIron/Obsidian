[[IO Input-Output]]
The first layer of the OSI model, also known as the Physical Layer, defines the physical means of transmitting data over a communication channel. This layer is responsible for specifying the electrical, mechanical, and functional characteristics of the physical media, such as the cables, connectors, and signaling methods. Its main functions include encoding, signaling, and transmitting data over the physical media, as well as detecting and correcting transmission errors.
