Python Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list but Tuples are immutable in nature i.e. the elements in the tuple cannot be added or removed once created. Just like a List, a Tuple can also contain elements of various types.
```
Tuple = ('This','is', 'Tuple')
```

[[🐍NamedTuple]] A NamedTuple returns a tuple object with names for each position which the ordinary tuples lack.
