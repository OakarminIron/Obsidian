Python dictionary is like [[Hash Tables]] in any other language with the time complexity of O(1). It is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds the key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. 



[[🐍Counters]] It is used to keep the count of the elements in an iterable in the form of an unordered dictionary where the key represents the element in the iterable and value represents the count of that element in the iterable.
[[🐍OrderedDict]]  a sub-class of dictionary but unlike dictionary, it remembers the order in which the keys were inserted. 
[[🐍DefaultDict]] It is used to provide some default values for the key that does not exist and never raises a Key Error.
[[🐍ChainMap]] encapsulates many dictionaries into a single unit and returns a list of dictionaries.
