Query languages and patterns play a crucial role in retrieving and manipulating data from APIs. They provide a standardized syntax and approach for querying data based on specific criteria. Here are some popular query languages and patterns used in API development:

[[SQL]]
[[GraphQL]]
[[OData]] 
[[JSONPath]]
[[XPath]]
[[XQuery]]
[[Regex]] 
[[LinQ]] (Language Integrated Query)
[[OQL]] (Object Query Language)
[[LogQL]]


These query languages and patterns offer different levels of expressiveness and flexibility for querying and manipulating data from APIs. The choice of query language or pattern depends on factors such as the data structure, complexity of the query requirements, and the capabilities of the API implementation.
