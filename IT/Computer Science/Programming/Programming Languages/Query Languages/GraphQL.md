A flexible query language for APIs allowing clients to request specific data. It was developed by Facebook and can combine data from multiple sources. 
What Engineers need to know: Understanding `GraphQL` can help in creating efficient APIs that prevent over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

- It allows clients to request and retrieve specific data they need, providing flexibility and reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
- `GraphQL` is both a query language and a runtime for APIs.
