A flexible query language for APIs allowing clients to request specific data. It was developed by Facebook and can combine data from multiple sources. 
What Engineers need to know: Understanding `GraphQL` can help in creating efficient APIs that prevent over-fetching and under-fetching of data. 

Although `GraphQL` is primarily a query language, it can also be considered an architectural style. It allows clients to request and retrieve specific data they need, providing flexibility and reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

`GraphQL` is both a query language and a runtime for APIs. It allows clients to specify the structure and shape of the data they need, enabling efficient and precise data retrieval. Clients can request multiple resources in a single query, eliminating over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
