Model-Driven Design is an approach that emphasizes the use of models to guide the software development process. Models, such as `UML` diagrams or other visual representations, are created to capture the structure, behavior, and relationships of the system being developed. These models serve as a blueprint for designing and implementing the software, providing a higher level of abstraction that can facilitate communication and reduce complexity.
