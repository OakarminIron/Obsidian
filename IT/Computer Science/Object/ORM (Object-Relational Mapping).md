- ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) are programming tools that provide a way to interact with a relational database using an [[👾🅾️ OOP Object]] Oriented approach.
- They allow developers to use familiar programming constructs like classes, objects, and methods to perform database operations, instead of writing raw SQL queries.
- ORMs provide an abstraction layer between the application and the database, simplifying the development process, and making it easier to switch between different database systems.
