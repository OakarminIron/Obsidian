1. Structured data: This type of data is organized in a highly organized format, typically in a tabular form with rows and columns. Structured data is usually found in databases and can be easily processed and analyzed using predefined rules or algorithms. Examples of structured data include sales records, customer information, and financial statements.
2. Unstructured data: Unstructured data does not have a predefined structure and is not organized in a tabular format. It can be in the form of text documents, emails, social media posts, multimedia files, or even sensor data. Unstructured data often requires advanced techniques, such as natural language processing or machine learning algorithms, to extract meaningful insights from it.
