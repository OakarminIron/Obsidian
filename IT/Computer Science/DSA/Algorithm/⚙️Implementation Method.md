- [[⚙️Recursion or Iteration:]] A recursive algorithm is an algorithm which calls itself again and again until a base condition is achieved whereas iterative algorithms use *loops* and/or data structures like stacks, queues to solve any problem. Every recursive solution can be implemented as an iterative solution and vice versa. 
Example: The Tower of Hanoi is implemented in a recursive fashion while Stock Span problem is implemented iteratively.
- [[⚙️Exact or Approximate]]: Algorithms that are capable of finding an optimal solution for any problem are known as the exact algorithm. For all those problems, where it is not possible to find the most optimized solution, an approximation algorithm is used. Approximate algorithms are the type of algorithms that find the result as an average outcome of sub outcomes to a problem. 
Example: For NP-Hard Problems, approximation algorithms are used. Sorting algorithms are the exact algorithms.
[[⚙️Serial or Parallel or Distributed Algorithms]]: In serial algorithms, one instruction is executed at a time while parallel algorithms are those in which we divide the problem into sub-problems and execute them on different processors. If parallel algorithms are distributed on different machines, then they are known as distributed algorithms.အဲ့ကောင်က Single thread multi thread နဲ့လဲသွားဆိုင်မယ်
