- [[⚙️Randomized Algorithms]]: Algorithms that make random choices for faster solutions are known as randomized algorithms. Example: Randomized Quick-sort Algorithm.
- [[⚙️Complexity]]: Algorithms that are classified on the basis of time taken to get a solution to any problem for input size. This analysis is known as time complexity analysis. Example: Some algorithms take O(n), while some take exponential time.
- [[⚙️Research Area]]: In CS each field has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Example: Sorting Algorithm, Searching Algorithm, Machine Learning etc.
- [[⚙️Branch and Bound Enumeration and Backtracking]]: These are mostly used in Artificial Intelligence.
