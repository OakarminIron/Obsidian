There are two approaches for designing an algorithm. these approaches include 

- [[Top-Down Approach]]  a large problem is divided into small sub-problem. and keep repeating the process of decomposing problems until the complex problem is solved.
- [[Bottom-up approach]] also known as the reverse of top-down approaches.In approach different, part of a complex program is solved using a programming language and then this is combined into a complete program.
