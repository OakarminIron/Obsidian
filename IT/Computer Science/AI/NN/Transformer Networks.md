A transformer model is a neural network that learns context and thus meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data like the words in this sentence.

Transformer models apply an evolving set of mathematical techniques, called [[ðŸ¤–Attention]] or self-attention, to detect subtle ways even distant data elements in a series influence and depend on each other.
