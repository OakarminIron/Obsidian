Deep learning (`DL`) is a subset of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence.
Deep learning is concerned with algorithms that can learn to recognize patterns in data, whereas machine learning is more general and deals with algorithms that can learn any kind of task.

A deep learning model, or a `DL` model, is a neural network that has been trained to learn how to perform a task, such as recognizing objects in digital images and videos, or understanding human speech.
Deep learning models are trained by using large [[Dataset]] and [[Algorithm⚙️]] that enable the model to learn how to perform the task. 
The more data the model is trained on, the better it can learn to perform the task.
