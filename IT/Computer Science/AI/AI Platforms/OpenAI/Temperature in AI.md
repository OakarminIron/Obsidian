Lowering temperature means it will take fewer risks, and completions will be more accurate and deterministic. 
Increasing temperature will result in more diverse completions.

In the realm of artificial intelligence, specifically in machine learning and neural networks, the concept of temperature is used to control the level of randomness or [[Chaos]] in the output of a model.
A higher temperature value results in more diverse and creative outputs, while a lower value produces more focused and deterministic responses.
