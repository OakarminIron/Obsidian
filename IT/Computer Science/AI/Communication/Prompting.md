1. Define the Problem (What You Want to Know)
	1. Define the Domain (Area of Scope): Identify the subject area or field relevant to the question, such as machine learning, finance, software development, etc. This ensures the AI understands the context.
	2. Clarify the Question: Simplify and sharpen the question for accuracy and focus. A clear, specific query helps generate precise answers.
	3. For complex topics, break down the query into smaller, iterative prompts. Start with a broad overview, then ask for details in follow-up prompts.
2. Input Context is Crucial
	1. Data Format (Input Type): Specify the format of the input data or media type, if applicable (e.g., text, images, audio, structured data like tables or databases). This helps AI tailor the output correctly.
	2. State any assumptions that the AI should work with. This gives a clear baseline and avoids confusion in the response."Assume I have intermediate knowledge of..."
3. Define AI's Identity and Role
	1. Personality and Tone: Set the desired tone of the interaction. Should the AI be formal, conversational, technical, or casual?
	2. Purpose and Processing Approach: Define how you want the AI to handle the question. Should it provide an overview, step-by-step guidance, in-depth analysis, or a quick summary?
	3. Key Values: Specify what you value in the response (e.g., clarity, simplicity, accuracy, creativity). This guides how the AI structures its answer.
4. Output Instructions
	1. Specify the Type of Output:
		1. Simple Cooked Output: A straightforward response like translating a document, summarising text, or converting data without in-depth processing.
		2. Processed Cooked Output: More complex tasks involving reasoning, calculations, or data manipulation (e.g., performing analysis, generating insights).
		3. Uncooked Output: Raw, unprocessed data that requires further interpretation (e.g., a list of potential solutions, unformulated search results).
