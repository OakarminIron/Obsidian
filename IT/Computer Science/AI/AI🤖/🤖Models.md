An AI model is a program that has been trained on a set of data to recognise certain patterns or make certain decisions without further human intervention. 
In the context of AI, a model is a mathematical representation of a real-world process. It's like a blueprint or a set of rules that the computer follows to perform a task. 
In the case of machine learning, a model is trained on data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
