Deep learning (`DL`) is a subset of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence.
A deep learning model, is a neural network  has 3 or more [[Hidden Layers]].

Deep learning models are trained by using large [[Dataset]] and [[Algorithm⚙️]] that enable the model to learn how to perform the task.

[[Feed Forward]] Do not hold back just move forward
[[Back propagation]] Move backwards through the neural network adjusting weights to improve outcome on next iteration.
[[Loss Function]] A Function that compares the ground truth to the prediction to determine the error rate.
