Artificial general intelligence (`AGI`), also referred to as strong AI or deep AI, is the concept of a machine with general intelligence that mimics human intelligence and/or behaviors, with the ability to learn and apply its intelligence to solve any problem. `AGI` can think, understand, and act in a way that is indistinguishable from that of a human in any given situation.
