`NLP` is a Machine Learning that can understand the context of a corpus(a body of related text)

What it does:
- Understanding: `NLP` techniques analyse and interpret written or spoken language, extracting meaning, sentiment, and intent from text or speech. This includes tasks like identifying parts of speech, recognising named entities (people, places, organisations), and understanding the relationships between words and sentences.
- Generation: `NLP` can also be used to generate human-like text, including translating languages, writing different kinds of creative text formats, summarising information, and even writing different kinds of creative content formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.
