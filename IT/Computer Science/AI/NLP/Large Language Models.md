- An `LLM` is a **deep learning model** built on top of **neural networks**, specifically **transformers**.
- It's trained on a massive dataset of text and code, allowing it to understand the nuances of human language and generate human-quality text.


**Key characteristics:**

- **Large size:** `LLMs` have millions or even billions of parameters, making them much larger than traditional language models.
- **Powerful capabilities:** They can perform various tasks like text generation, translation, question answering, and summarize.
- **Continuously learning:** `LLMs` can be further fine-tuned for specific tasks or domains with additional data.
