Nodes represent entities or objects in the graph. 
They can represent various entities such as people, places, things, or abstract concepts. 
Each node can have one or more properties associated with it, which are key-value pairs containing information about the entity. For example, in a social network graph, nodes could represent users, and their properties might include attributes like name, age, and location.
