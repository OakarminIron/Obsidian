Relationships (also known as edges) define the connections or associations between nodes. 
Relationships have a type that describes the nature of the connection between nodes.
Like nodes, relationships can also have properties, which provide additional information about the connection. 

For instance, in a social network, a `FriendOf` relationship type might connect two user nodes, and the relationship properties could include the date when they became friends.
