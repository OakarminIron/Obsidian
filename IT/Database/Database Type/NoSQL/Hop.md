 In the context of graph theory and graph databases hop refer to the number of steps or transitions required to move from one node (or vertex) to another by following the edges (or relationships) in a graph.
 Each hop represents a single movement from one node to a directly connected node along an edge. Counting hops is a way to measure the distance or connectivity between nodes in a graph, and it is often used in graph algorithms and analyses to understand the relationships and paths within a graph.
