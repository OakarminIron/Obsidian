In database systems, consistency (or correctness) refers to the requirement that any given database transaction must change affected data only in allowed ways. 

Any data written to the database must be **valid** according to all 
	- defined rules
	- including constraints
	- cascades
	- triggers, and 
	- any combination thereof.
