### XQuery

XQuery is a database language that allows you to extract and manipulate data in XML formats, which is a way to share data on the internet. You can use XQuery to access and retrieve any data source in an XML format. With XQuery, you can generate reports on data within an XML database, search text documents on the web for data and extract data for use online.

### OQL

OQL, which stands for Object Query Language, is the standard language for object-oriented databases, which represent data as variables, functions or data structures. These databases are popular with companies that want to store large amounts of complex data. Much like SQL does in relational databases, OQL gives you the option to perform queries and retrieve data in object databases.

### SQL/XML

The SQL/XML language is a combination of SQL and XQuery that supports the manipulation and storage of XML data in a database that works with SQL. It enables applications to perform SQL statements on XML data and vice versa. It's helpful when you want to extract content from an XML document or if you want to ensure compatibility with future optimizations or systems that may only support XML.

### GraphQL

GraphQL is an open-source language that works with APIs, which are interfaces that allow users to interact with data. It provides a way to define the structure of data and how the system returns information in order to prevent the release of excessive amounts of data. It's helpful when you want to extract data from multiple APIs, aggregate data from different sources or specify the data efficiently.

### LINQ

LINQ, or Language Integrated Query, is a language that extracts and processes data from XML documents, relational databases and other third-party sources. With LINQ, you can access data through various sources without having to use a separate database language for each one. This ensures consistency among queries for objects, relational databases and XML, allowing you to filter, order and group operations.
