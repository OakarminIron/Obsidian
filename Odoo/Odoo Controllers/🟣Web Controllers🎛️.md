In Odoo, web controllers are a class that can be used to connect the [[Odoo Frontend]] with the [[Odoo Back-end]] models.
Controllers need to provide extensibility, much like Model, but can’t use the same mechanism as the pre-requisites (a database with loaded modules) may not be available yet (e.g. no database created, or no database selected).
