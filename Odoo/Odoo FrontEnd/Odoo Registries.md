- Registries are (ordered) key/value maps. 
- They are the main web client extension points: many features provided by the Odoo JavaScript framework simply look up into a registry whenever it needs a definition for some object (such as fields, views, client actions or services). 
- Customizing the web client is then simply done by adding specific values in the correct registry.
- A useful feature of registries is that they maintain a set of sub registries, obtained by the `category` method.
- If the sub registry does not exist yet, it is created on the fly. 
- All registries used by the web client are obtained in such a way from one root registry, exported in `@web/core/registry`.
