The main building blocks of OWL are [[游불游빓OWL Components]] and [[OWL Templates]]

The Odoo JavaScript framework uses a custom component framework called Owl. It is a declarative component system, loosely inspired by `Vue` and React. Components are defined using [[游릮QWeb]] enriched with some Owl specific directives. The official[Owl documentation](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/readme.md)맊ontains a complete reference and a tutorial.
