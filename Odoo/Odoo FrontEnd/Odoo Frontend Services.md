Services are long lived pieces of code that provide a feature. They may be imported by components (with use Service) or by other services. Also, they can declare a set of dependencies. In that sense, services are basically a DI (dependency injection) system. For example, the notification service provides a way to display a notification, or the RPC service is the proper way to perform a request to the Odoo server.
