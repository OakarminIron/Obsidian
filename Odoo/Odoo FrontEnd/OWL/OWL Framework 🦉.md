The main building blocks of OWL are [[🦉🧰OWL Components]] and [[OWL Templates]]

The Odoo JavaScript framework uses a custom component framework called Owl. It is a declarative component system, loosely inspired by Vue and React. Components are defined using [[QWeb]] enriched with some Owl specific directives. The official [Owl documentation](https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/readme.md) contains a complete reference and a tutorial.
