While working on a project for a client, employees often have to spend their own money on various expenses related to the project.
For example, an employee may need to use their own money to pay for a hotel, while they provide an on-site service for a client.
As a company, this expense should be [[Re-invoice]] to the customer. With `Odoo`, these kinds of expenses can quickly be re-invoiced to the customer related to the project.
