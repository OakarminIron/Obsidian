Product forecasting from vendors reduces costs and optimises resource usage by enhancing inventory control. 
It also enhances planning and budgeting by predicting future procurement costs, allowing businesses to allocate resources more efficiently. 
Through the 'Vendor Bills' page in the 'Settings' menu enabling this feature allows the system to predict vendor bill lines based on previous bills' history.
