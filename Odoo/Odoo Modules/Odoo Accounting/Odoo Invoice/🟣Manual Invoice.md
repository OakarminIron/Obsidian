Users can also create invoices manually without using contracts or a sales order. Itâ€™s a recommended approach if you do not need to manage the sales process (quotations), or the delivery of the products or services.

Even if you generate the invoice from a sales order, you may need to create invoices manually in exceptional use cases:

-   if you need to create a refund    
-   If you need to give a discount    
-   if you need to change an invoice created from a sales order    
-   if you need to invoice something not related to your core business
