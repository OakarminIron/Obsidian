In most companies, salespeople create quotations that become sales order once they are validated. Then, draft invoices are created based on the sales order. You have different options like:

-   Invoice manually: use a button on the sale order to trigger the draft invoice    
-   Invoice before delivery: invoice the full order before triggering the delivery order    
-   Invoice based on delivery order: see next section    

Invoice before delivery is usually used by the eCommerce application when the customer pays at the order and we deliver afterwards. (pre-paid)

For most other use cases, itâ€™s recommended to invoice manually. It allows the salesperson to trigger the invoice on demand with options: invoice the whole order, invoice a percentage (advance), invoice some lines, invoice a fixed advance.

This process is good for both services and physical products.
