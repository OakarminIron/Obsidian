If you use contracts, you can trigger invoice based on time and material spent, expenses or fixed lines of services/products. Every month, the salesperson will trigger invoice based on activities on the contract.

Activities can be:

-   fixed products/services, coming from a sale order linked to this contract    
-   materials purchased (that you will re-invoice)    
-   time and material based on timesheets or purchases (subcontracting)    
-   expenses like travel and accommodation that you re-invoice to the customer    

You can invoice at the end of the contract or trigger intermediate invoices. This approach is used by services companies that invoice mostly based on time and material. For services companies that invoice on fix price, they use a regular sales order.
