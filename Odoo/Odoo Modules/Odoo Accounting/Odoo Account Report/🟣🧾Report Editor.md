To create a new report, go to `Accounting ‣ Configuration ‣ Management: Accounting Reports`. 
From here, you can either create a root report or a variant.


- [[🟣🧾Root or Variant]]
	- Root reports can be regarded as generic, neutral accounting reports.
	- They serve as models on which local accounting versions are built. 
	- If a report has no root report, it is considered to be a root report itself.
	- Variants are country-specific versions of root reports and, therefore, always refer to a root report.
