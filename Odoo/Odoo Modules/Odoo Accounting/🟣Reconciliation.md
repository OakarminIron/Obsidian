Bank reconciliation is the process of matching your bank transactions with your business records
Thanks to the bank [[ðŸŸ£Reconciliation Models]], Odoo` pre-selects` the matching entries automatically.
[[account.bank.statement]]
If you are not sure how to reconcile a particular transaction and would like to deal with it later, use the To Check button instead. 
All transactions marked as To Check can be displayed using the To Check filter.
