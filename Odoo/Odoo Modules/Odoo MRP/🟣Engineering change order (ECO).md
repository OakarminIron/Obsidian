The need for an engineering change may be triggered by a number of events and varies by industry. 

[[ðŸŸ£ECO Categories]]


An ECO must contain at least this information:

-   Identification of what needs to be changed. Product
-   Reason(s) for the change.
-   Description of the change.  __[[Engineering BOM]]__
-   List of documents and departments affected by the change. The most important part of making a change is to see that all pertinent groups are notified and all documents updated.
-   Approval of the change. As with the detail and assembly drawings, the changes must be approved only by those individuals that are authorized to approve such a document. Typically, a number of individuals approve changes related to their own specialty with a final overall approval from management. __Responsible__
-   Instruction about when to introduce the changeâ€” __Effective__ ASAP  or at date.




An engineering change order, also called an engineering change notice, engineering change, or engineering release notice, is an artifact used to implement changes to components or end products. The ECO is utilized to control and coordinate changes to product designs that evolve over time.
