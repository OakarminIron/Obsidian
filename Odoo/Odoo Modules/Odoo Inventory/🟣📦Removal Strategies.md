[[Inventory Costing Method for COGS]]


- `FIFO` strategy states that if a product is stocked first, it will go out first in the delivery order if a sales order is confirmed.
- `LIFO` strategy is the inverse of `FIFO`, stating that if a product was stocked last, it would go out first in a delivery order if a sales order is confirmed.
- `FEFO`  (The First Expired, First Out) removal approach is distinct from the other two. The expiration date is more relevant than the day the product joined the stock.Need loot numbers.
- Another distinct strategy, `Closest Location`, focuses more on the product's physical location within the warehouse rather than the chronological order of entry. This approach is often employed for products that maintain consistent quality over time, offering an alternative method for strategic inventory management.
