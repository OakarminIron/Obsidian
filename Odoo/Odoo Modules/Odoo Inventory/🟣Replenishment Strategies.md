Also [[🟣Reordering Rules]]
The products can be replenished by moving them between warehouses. 
For distributing items and raw materials among warehouses, `Odoo` offers the “Resupply” option. 
This is possible when products are unavailable in any of the warehouses. The `Odoo` Inventory module makes this process rather simple.

1. Min/Max: This strategy involves setting minimum and maximum stock levels for each product. When the stock level falls below the minimum, a replenishment order is triggered to bring the stock back up to the maximum level.
2. Make to Order (`MTO`):is a procurement route that creates a draft purchase order (or manufacturing order) each time a sales order is confirmed, **regardless of the current stock level**.
3. Make to Stock (`MTS`): This strategy involves producing or purchasing items based on forecast-ed demand. The goal is to maintain a certain level of stock to fulfil potential customer orders.
4. Reorder Point (`ROP`): The reorder point is a predefined stock level that, when reached, triggers a replenishment order. This strategy takes into account factors like lead time and demand variability.
5. Just in Time (`JIT`): This strategy aims to minimise inventory levels by replenishing items just in time to meet customer demand. It requires precise coordination with suppliers and a streamlined production process.
6. Forecast-Based Replenishment: This strategy involves using demand forecasts to anticipate future stock requirements. Replenishment orders are generated based on the projected demand.
7. ABC Analysis: This strategy classifies products into categories (A, B, C) based on their value and usage frequency. Different replenishment strategies are then applied to each category. For example, high-value and high-usage items might have different replenishment rules than low-value and low-usage items.
8. Vendor Managed Inventory (`VMI`): With `VMI`, the supplier monitors the inventory levels at the customer's location and replenishes the stock automatically when it falls below a certain threshold.
