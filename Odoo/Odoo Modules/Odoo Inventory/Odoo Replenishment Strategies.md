The products can be replenished by moving them between warehouses. For distributing items and raw materials among warehouses, Odoo offers the “Resupply” option. This is possible when products are unavailable in any of the warehouses. The Odoo Inventory module makes this process rather simple.

1. Min/Max: This strategy involves setting minimum and maximum stock levels for each product. When the stock level falls below the minimum, a replenishment order is triggered to bring the stock back up to the maximum level.
2. Make to Order (`MTO`): In this strategy, products are only manufactured or purchased when customer orders are received. There is no need to maintain a constant stock of these items.
3. Make to Stock (`MTS`): This strategy involves producing or purchasing items based on forecast-ed demand. The goal is to maintain a certain level of stock to fulfill potential customer orders.
4. Reorder Point (`ROP`): The reorder point is a predefined stock level that, when reached, triggers a replenishment order. This strategy takes into account factors like lead time and demand variability.
5. Just in Time (`JIT`): This strategy aims to minimize inventory levels by replenishing items just in time to meet customer demand. It requires precise coordination with suppliers and a streamlined production process.
6. Forecast-Based Replenishment: This strategy involves using demand forecasts to anticipate future stock requirements. Replenishment orders are generated based on the projected demand.
7. ABC Analysis: This strategy classifies products into categories (A, B, C) based on their value and usage frequency. Different replenishment strategies are then applied to each category. For example, high-value and high-usage items might have different replenishment rules than low-value and low-usage items.
8. Vendor Managed Inventory (`VMI`): With `VMI`, the supplier monitors the inventory levels at the customer's location and replenishes the stock automatically when it falls below a certain threshold.
