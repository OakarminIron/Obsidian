Then, in theÂ WarehouseÂ section, enable theÂ Multi-Step RoutesÂ feature and clickÂ Save.

If the route is applicable on [[ğŸŸ£Sales Order Line]], it is more or less the opposite. 
The route must be manually chosen when creating a quotation. This is useful if some products go through different routes.
Remember to toggle the visibility of theÂ RouteÂ column on the quotation/sales order. Then, the route can be chosen on each line of the quotation/sales order.
