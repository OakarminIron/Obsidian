[[Inventory Costing Method for COGS]]
The product costing method in the `Odoo` inventory module classifies into three categories. 
It includes 
	- Standard Price
	- First in First Out
	- Average Cost. 

Estimated inventory value affects several factors, such as net profit, gross income, current assets, and working capital.
