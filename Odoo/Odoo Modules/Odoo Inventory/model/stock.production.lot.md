A **lot** number (also called serial number in Odoo) can be considered as a serial number for a single product, or a batch containing quantities of a certain product. Lots are typically used to identify a serial number (for a computer, printer, ...), or as production lots to indicate for instance quality grades or delivery lots. You can make it mandatory to enter a lot number according to the **incoming/outgoing/full traceability** options ticked in the _Product Variant_ form.
