A **Location** is a specific space within the warehouse. It can be a sub-location of the warehouse (a shelf, a floor, an aisle, and so on). Therefore, a location is part of one warehouse only and it is not possible to link one location to multiple warehouses. In Odoo, as many locations can be configured as needed under one warehouse.
