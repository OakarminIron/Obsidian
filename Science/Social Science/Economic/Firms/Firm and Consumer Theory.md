[[Theory of Firm]]
[[Consumer Theory]]

The theory of the firm works side by side with the theory of the consumer, which states that consumers seek to maximize their overall utility. 
In this case, utility refers to the perceived value a consumer places on a good or service, sometimes referred to as the level of happiness the customer experiences from the good or service.
