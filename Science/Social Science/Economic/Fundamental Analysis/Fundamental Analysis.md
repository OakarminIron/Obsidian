-   Fundamental analysis is a method of determining a stock's real or "fair market" value.
-   Fundamental analysts search for stocks currently trading at prices higher or lower than their real value.
	-   If the fair market value is higher than the market price, the stock is deemed undervalued, and a buy recommendation is given.
	-   If the fair market value is lower than the market price, the stock is deemed overvalued, and the recommendation might be not to buy or to sell if the stock is held.
-   In contrast, technical analysts favor studying the historical price trends of the stock to predict short-term future trends.
 
Fundamental analysis is usually done from a macro to micro perspective to identify securities that are not correctly priced by the market.

-   **Quantitative**: information that can be shown using numbers, figures, ratios, or formulas
-   **Qualitative**: rather than a quantity of something, it is its quality, standard, or nature

In this context, quantitative fundamentals are hard numbers. They are the measurable characteristics of a business. That's why the biggest source of quantitative data is financial statements. Revenue, profit, assets, and more can be accurately measured.
The qualitative fundamentals are less tangible. They might include the quality of a company's key executives, brand-name recognition, patents(ပါမစ်), and proprietary technology.Neither qualitative nor quantitative analysis is inherently better. Many analysts consider them together
