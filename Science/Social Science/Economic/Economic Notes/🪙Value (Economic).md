In economics, economic value is a measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an economic agent.
It is generally measured through units of currency, and the interpretation is therefore 
-->     `what is the maximum amount of money a person is willing and able to pay for a good or service?`

Among the competing schools of economic theory there are differing theories of value.

[[🪙Service Value]]

[[🪙Value Driven Design]]
