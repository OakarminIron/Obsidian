Service value refers to the benefits, advantages, or utility that customers receive when they use a particular service.
Services are intangible offerings that cater to customers' needs, wants, or problems, and they are typically provided by businesses to enhance the customer experience or solve specific issues.
Service value is not only about the functional benefits of the service but also encompasses emotional and experiential aspects.

Some key points about service value include:
	- Intangibility: Services are intangible and cannot be physically touched or possessed. Instead, they provide experiences, expertise, or solutions.
	- Customer-Centric: Service value is often tailored to meet the unique needs and preferences of individual customers or segments.
	- Experience and Interaction: The interaction between service providers and customers, as well as the overall experience of using the service, play a crucial role in determining its value.
	- Customization: Services can be customized or personalized based on customer requirements, leading to a higher perceived value.

Examples: Examples of services include consulting, healthcare, education, banking, and hospitality.
For instance, the value of a healthcare service includes not only medical treatment but also the care, empathy, and attention provided to patients.
