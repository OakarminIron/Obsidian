[[Economic resources]] are scare. 
Faced with this scarcity, the fact that there is a limited amount of resources to satisfy unlimited wants, 
so we must choose how to allocate our resources. Economic is the study of how societies choose to do that.
Microeconomics focus on how individuals, households, and firms make those decisions.

Scarcity is why economic exist. We don't need to worry about how scare resources are allocated if those resources were unlimited.
It should be emphasized that economic is primarily concerned with the scarcity of resources.
