The circular flow diagram illustrates the flow of goods, services, and money between these entities. It shows that households supply resources to businesses in the form of labor, land, and capital. In return, businesses pay wages, salaries, and other forms of income to households. Households then use this income to purchase goods and services from businesses. This creates a circular flow of money.

The diagram also represents the flow of goods and services. Businesses produce goods and services, which they sell to households. In turn, households consume these goods and services, creating a continuous cycle of production and consumption.

The circular flow diagram provides a simplified representation of the complex interactions in an economy, highlighting the interdependence between households, businesses, and the government.
