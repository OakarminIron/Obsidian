
The utility definition in economics is derived from the concept of usefulness. An economic good yields utility to the extent to which it's useful for satisfying a consumerâ€™s want or need.


[[Economic Utility Types]]


- Utility, in economics, refers to the usefulness or enjoyment a consumer can get from a service or good.
- Although the concept of utility is abstract, it is a useful way to explain how and why consumers make their decisions.
- "Ordinal" utility refers to the concept of one good being more useful or desirable than another.
- "Cardinal" utility is the idea of measuring economic value through imaginary units, known as "utils."
- Marginal utility is the utility gained by consuming an additional unit of a service or good.
