[[Form Utility]]
Form utility refers to how much value a consumer receives from a product or service in a way that they actually need. Form utility is, therefore, the incorporation of customer needs and wants into the features and benefits of the products being offered by the company.

[[Time Utility]]
This type of utility occurs when a company provides goods and services when consumers demand or need them. Companies analyze how to create or maximize the time utility of their products and adjust their production process, logistical planning of manufacturing, and delivery. So when demand increases, the company should respond by producing and delivering more of the product to the market.

[[Place Utility]]
Place utility refers to making goods or services available in locations that allow consumers to easily access products and services.
While most people typically think of place utility as a physical or brick-and-mortar location, such as a retail store or shopping mall, the digital age helps broaden the definition of availability. 
For instance, companies can maximize place utility through their website. Those with effective search engine optimization strategies can improve their place utility.
Increasing convenience for customers can be a key element in attracting business. 
For example, a company that offers easy access to technical support gives consumers an added value compared to a similar company that does not offer a similar service.

[[Possession Utility]]
Possession utility is the amount of usefulness or perceived value a consumer derives from owning a specific product and being able to use it as soon as possible. The basic premise behind this utility is that consumers should be able to use a specific good or service as soon as they're able to purchase or obtain it.
For instance, someone who purchases the latest iPhone won't get much utility for the product if Apple has it on back-order and can't manufacture and ship it to the consumer in a timely fashion.
