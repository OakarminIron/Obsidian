- Utility maximization is the concept that individuals and organizations seek to attain the highest level of satisfaction from their economic decisions.
- Utility function measures the intensity to which an individual’s fulfillment is met.
- [[Utility (economic)]] decreases with the increase in the consumption of a good or service.

The combination of goods or services that maximize utility is determined by comparing the marginal utility of two choices and finding the alternative with the highest total utility within the budget limit. The decision is influenced by the option that produces a higher level of satisfaction. This explains how companies and individuals develop consumption habits.

The consumer may consider purchasing more of one item and less of another. Through maximizing utility, the consumer will buy an item that produces the greatest marginal utility with the least amount of spending.

[[Total Utility]]
