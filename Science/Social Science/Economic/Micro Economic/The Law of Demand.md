-   The law of demand is a fundamental principle of economics that states that at a higher price, consumers will demand a lower quantity of a good.
-   Demand is derived from the law of diminishing marginal utility, the fact that consumers use economic goods to satisfy their most urgent needs first.
-   A market demand curve expresses the sum of quantity demanded at each price across all consumers in the market.
-   Changes in price can be reflected in movement along a demand curve, but by themselves, they do not increase or decrease demand.
-   The shape and magnitude of demand shifts in response to changes in consumer preferences, incomes, or related economic goods, NOT to changes in price.
