One downside of capitalism is its incentives to corrupt. 
Crony capitalism refers to a capitalist society that is based on the close relationships between business people and the state. 
Instead of success being determined by a free market and the rule of law, the success of a business is dependent on the favoritism(ကြိုက်တဲ့သူပဲ) 
that is shown to it by the government in the form of အခွန်ရှောင်,  ပါမစ်ကျ, and other incentives.

[[Tycoon]] တိုင်ကွန်း
- A tycoon is a prominent figure in a particular industry who has amassed substantial wealth and power while building a business empire.
- Tycoons are often identified in industries that have economic prominence.
- Tycoon was first used to describe wealthy industrialists who dominated their industries in the 19th and 20th centuries.
- The word tycoon comes from the Japanese _taikun,_ originally used to describe military leaders.
- The term tycoon is less negative than the term [[Robber Baron]], which was applied to many tycoons because of abusive business tactics.
- Traditionally tycoons were in industrial sectors like oil, steel, and rail. Now many modern tycoons own businesses in technology and entertainment.
- Wealthy investors with large holdings are not generally considered tycoons, as they are investing with entrepreneurs rather than operating a business themselves.
