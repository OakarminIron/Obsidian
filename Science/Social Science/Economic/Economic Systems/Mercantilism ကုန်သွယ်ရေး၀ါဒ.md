-   Mercantilism was the dominant economic system from the 16th century to the 18th century.
-   Mercantilism was based on the idea that a nation's wealth and power were best served by increasing exports and reducing imports.
-   It's characterized by the belief that global wealth was static and that a nation's economic health relied heavily on its supply of capital.
-   Due to the nationalistic nature of mercantilism, nations frequently used military might to protect local markets and supply sources.
-   Mercantilism was replaced by free-trade economic theory in the mid-18th century.


Mercantilism had several noteworthy characteristics.

**1. The Belief in the Static Nature of Wealth** သဘာ၀ရင်းမြစ်
Financial wealth was considered limited (due to the rarity of precious metals). Nations that sought prosperity and power needed to secure as much wealth as possible, at the expense of other nations.

**2. The Need to Increase the Supply of Gold**
Gold represented wealth and power. It could pay for soldiers, seafaring exploration for natural resources, and expanding empires. It could also protect against invasion. A lack of gold meant the downfall of a nation.

**3. The Need to Maintain a Trade Surplus** များများပို့နဲနဲသွင်း
This was integral to building wealth. Nations needed to focus on selling their exports (and collecting the associated revenue) more than on spending on imports (and sending gold out of countries).

**4. The Importance of a Large Population**
Large populations represented wealth. Increasing a nation's population was integral to supplying a labor force, supporting domestic commerce, and maintaining armies.

**5. The Use of Colonies to Support Wealth**
Some nations needed colonies for raw materials, a labor supply, and a way to keep wealth within its control (by selling colonies the products their raw materials helped to produce). Essentially, colonies increased a nation's wealth-building power and national security.

**6. The Use of Protectionism**
Protecting a nation's ability to build and maintain trade surpluses encompassed prohibiting colonies from trading with other nations and imposing tariffs on imported goods.
