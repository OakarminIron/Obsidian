- Socialism is an economic and political system based on collective ownership of the means of production.
- All legal production and distribution decisions are made by the government in a socialist system. 
- The government also determines all output and pricing levels and supplies its citizens with everything from food to healthcare.
- Proponents of socialism believe that it leads to a more equal distribution of goods and services and a more equitable society.
- Socialist ideals include production for use, rather than for profit; an equitable distribution of wealth and material resources among all people; no more competitive buying and selling in the market; and free access to goods and services.
- Capitalism, with its belief in private ownership and the goal to maximize profits, stands in contrast to socialism, but most capitalist economies today have some socialist aspects.
