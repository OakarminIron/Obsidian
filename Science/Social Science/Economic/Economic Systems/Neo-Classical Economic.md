Neoclassical economics is a broad theory that focuses on supply and demand as the driving forces behind the production, pricing, and consumption of goods and services. It emerged in around 1900 to compete with the earlier theories of classical economics.

- Neoclassical economists argue that the consumer's perception of a product's value is the driving factor in its price.
- The difference between actual production costs and retail price is the economic surplus.
- Neoclassical economic theory can impact how businesses operate gov and financial institutions operate, as well as how governments regulate markets.
- Critics argue the theory doesn't account for other factors that impact consumer decisions, such as limited information, resource inequality, or emotional thinking.

[[Neo-Classical Principles]]

The main assumptions of neoclassical economics are that consumers make rational decisions to maximize utility, that businesses aim to maximize profits, that people act independently based on having all the relevant information related to a choice or action, and that markets will self-regulate in response to supply and demand.
