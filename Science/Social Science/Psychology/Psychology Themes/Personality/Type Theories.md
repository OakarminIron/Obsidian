[[Introvert]]  and [[Extrovert]]

[[Type-A,Type-B]]

Hans Eysenck was a German-British psychologist who developed a model of personality that divided personality into three dimensions: introversion-extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism.

According to [[Eysenck's model]], introversion-extraversion is a dimension that reflects how much a person is inclined towards social interaction and stimulation. People who are high in extraversion are outgoing, energetic, and sociable, while people who are high in introversion are more reserved, introspective, and inclined towards solitude.

The dimension of neuroticism reflects how prone a person is to experiencing negative emotions, such as anxiety, sadness, and insecurity. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be more emotionally reactive and may experience more negative emotions.

The dimension of psychoticism reflects a person's tendency towards anti-social behavior, aggression, and impulsivity. People who are high in psychoticism may be more prone to aggressive or impulsive behavior and may have a harder time following rules and social norms.

Eysenck's model of personality has been influential in the field of psychology, but it has also been the subject of criticism and debate. Some researchers have argued that the model oversimplifies personality and does not adequately capture the complexity of human behavior.
