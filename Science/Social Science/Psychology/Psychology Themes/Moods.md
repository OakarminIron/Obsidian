Moods are less tied to specific triggers and are often influenced by a combination of factors, including biological, psychological, and environmental elements. They can affect our overall disposition and color our perceptions, thoughts, and behaviors. Moods are typically described using broader terms such as "happy," "sad," "irritable," "calm," or "anxious."
