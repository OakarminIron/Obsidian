Feelings are generally considered to be conscious subjective experiences that arise in response to a particular stimulus or situation. They often involve a cognitive component and can be influenced by thoughts, beliefs, and interpretations. Feelings are usually more fleeting and temporary in nature. For example, you might feel joy, sadness, anger, or fear in response to a specific event or situation.
