- Safety needs include personal and emotional security (e.g., safety from abuse), financial security, and well-being.
- According to Maslow, there are two sub-types of esteem. 
	- The first is esteem reflected in others’ perceptions of us. That is, esteem in the form of prestige, status, recognition, attention, appreciation, or admiration
	- The second form of esteem is rooted in a desire for confidence, strength, independence, and the ability to achieve.
	- Further, Maslow notes that when our esteem needs are thwarted, feelings of inferiority, weakness, or helplessness are likely to arise


"A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is to be ultimately happy. What a man can be, he must be. This need we may call self-actualization.” Maslow (1943, p. 382)

Toward the end of his career, Maslow revisited his original conceptualization of the pyramid and argued a sixth need above self-actualization.
He called this need self-transcendence, defined as a person’s desire to “further a cause beyond the self and to experience a communion beyond the boundaries of the self through peak experience”
Examples of peak experiences can include mystical experiences, interactions with nature, and sexual experiences wherein a person’s sense of self transcends beyond the personal self (Koltko-Rivera, 2006).
