- [[Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET)]]: explains the relationship between internal motivation and external rewards. 
- [[Organismic Integration Theory (OIT)]]: suggests different types of extrinsic motivations and how they contribute to the socialization of the individual. This mini-theory suggests that people willingly participate in activities and behaviors that they do not find interesting or enjoyable because they are influenced by external motivators.
- [[Causality Orientations Theory (COT)]]: explores individual differences in the way people motivate themselves in regards to their personality.
- [[Basic Needs Theory (BNT)]]: considers three psychological needs that are related to intrinsic motivation, effective functioning, high quality engagement, and psychological well-being. 
- [[Goal Contents Theory (GCT)]]: compares the benefits of intrinsic goals to the negative outcomes of external goals in terms of psychological well-being.
- [[Relationship Motivation Theory (RMT)]]: examines the importance of relationships. This theory posits that high quality relationships satisfy all three psychological needs described in `BNT`. Of the three needs, relatedness is impacted the most by high quality relationships but autonomy and competence are satisfied as well.
