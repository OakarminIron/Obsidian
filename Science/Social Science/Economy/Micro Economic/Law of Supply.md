-   Because businesses seek to increase revenue, when they expect to receive a higher price for something, they will produce more of it.
-   Meanwhile, if prices fall, suppliers are disincentive from producing as much.
-   Supply in a market can be depicted as an upward-sloping supply curve that shows how the quantity supplied will respond to various prices over a period of time.
-   Together with demand, it forms half of the law of supply and demand.
