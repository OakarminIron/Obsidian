Product value, refers to the worth or benefit that customers derive from using a tangible product. 
Products are physical objects that customers can see, touch, and possess.
Product value encompasses the functional benefits the product provides as well as any emotional or psychological benefits associated with ownership or use. 

Some key points about product value include:
	- Tangibility: Products are tangible, physical items that customers can interact with directly.
	- Features and Functionality: The features, functions, and attributes of a product contribute to its value proposition. A product's value is often linked to its utility and how effectively it meets customer needs.
	- Ownership: Product value can extend beyond the functional benefits to include emotional aspects like status, aesthetics, and pride of ownership.
	- Durability and Longevity: The lifespan and durability of a product can influence its perceived value. A high-quality, long-lasting product is likely to be seen as more valuable.

Examples: Examples of products include smartphones, clothing, appliances, and vehicles. 
For example, the value of a smartphone product includes its features, performance, design, and the convenience it brings to the user's life.
