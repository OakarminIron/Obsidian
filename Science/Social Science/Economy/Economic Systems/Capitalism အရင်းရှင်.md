Capitalism is an economic system in which private individuals or businesses own capital goods. At the same time, business owners (capitalists) employ workers (labor) who only receive wages; labor does not own the means of production but only uses them on behalf of the owners of [[Capital]].

The production of goods and services under capitalism is based on supply and demand in the general market—known as a [[Market economy]]

-   Capitalism is an economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of production, especially in the industrial sector, with labor paid only wages.
-   Capitalism depends on the enforcement of private property rights, which provide incentives for investment in and productive use of productive capital.
-   Pure capitalism can be contrasted with pure socialism (where all means of production are collective or state-owned) and mixed economies (which lie on a continuum between pure capitalism and pure socialism).
-   The real-world practice of capitalism typically involves some degree of so-called “[[Crony capitalism ပေါင်းစား]]” due to demands from business for favorable government intervention and governments’ incentive to intervene in the economy.

Capitalism is essentially an economic system whereby the means of production (i.e., factories, tools, machines, raw materials, etc.) are organized by one or more business owners (capitalists). Capitalists then hire workers to operate the means of production in return for wages. Workers, however, do not have any claim on the means of production nor on the profits generated from their labor - these belong to the capitalists.
