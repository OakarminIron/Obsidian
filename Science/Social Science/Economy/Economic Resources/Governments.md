The government plays a significant role in the circular flow. It collects taxes from both households and businesses and provides various public goods and services such as infrastructure, defense, education, healthcare, and social welfare programs. The government also purchases goods and services from businesses and provides transfer payments, such as welfare benefits or subsidies, to households.
