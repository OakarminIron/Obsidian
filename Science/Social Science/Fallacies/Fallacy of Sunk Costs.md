[[Sunk Cost]] Fallacy describes our tendency to follow through on an endeavor if we have already invested time, effort, or money into it, whether or not the current costs outweigh the benefits.

- Loss aversion
- Framing Effects
- An overoptimistic probability bias
- The requisite of personal responsibility.
- The desire not to appear wasteful


To avoid

-   **Frame the problem.** The root of decision-making must start with a very specific problem that needs to be solved. This problem should be the central focal point of discussion and should drive all actions from analysts.
-   **Remain independent.** When people become emotional invested in business decisions, they may lose sight into what is really happening. Instead of relying on data, they have an unrealistically optimistic outlook on their poor decision. 
-   **Trust the data.** When comparing several options, sunk cost is most often excluded. This may feel inappropriate to do, but the process makes sense and delivers the most reliable basis for decision-making.
- Change risk preference Some investors actively seek out risk as they believe those types of investments offer the greatest returns. On the other hand, other investors still stick cash under the mattress and would rather forfeit any potential growth out of liquidity protection.
