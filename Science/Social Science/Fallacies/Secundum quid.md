`Secundum quid` is a Latin phrase that translates to "according to what" or "in respect to what." It is a term used in logic and philosophy, particularly in the context of [[Aristotle]]'s philosophy, to indicate a partial or qualified truth.

In Aristotelian logic, `secundum quid` refers to a fallacy that occurs when a general rule or principle is incorrectly applied to a particular case without considering its specific circumstances or exceptions. It involves making an over-generalization or drawing a hasty conclusion based on incomplete or limited information.

To illustrate this, consider the following example: "All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Therefore, penguins can fly." This argument fails to recognize the specific characteristic of penguins, which are flightless birds. It applies the general rule that birds can fly without considering the exception.

In essence, `secundum quid` serves as a reminder to consider the context and specific conditions when applying general principles or making judgments. It emphasizes the importance of nuanced and careful reasoning to avoid logical errors and misinterpretations.
