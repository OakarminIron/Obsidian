A formal fallacy, also known as a logical fallacy, is an error in reasoning or argumentation that occurs due to a flaw in the structure or form of an argument. Unlike informal fallacies, which involve errors in content or meaning, formal fallacies focus on the logical structure of an argument.

Formal fallacies occur when the logical structure of an argument is invalid, even if the premises and conclusion may seem individually true. In other words, a formal fallacy occurs when the argument's structure does not guarantee that the conclusion follows logically from the premises.

Examples of formal fallacies include:

1.  Affirming the consequent: Assuming that if a certain condition is met, the result must also be true. For example: "If it is raining, then the streets are wet. The streets are wet, therefore it is raining." This reasoning is flawed because other factors could make the streets wet, such as a recent water hose spray.
    
2.  Denying the antecedent: Assuming that if a certain condition is not met, the result must also be false. For example: "If it is raining, then the streets are wet. It is not raining, therefore the streets are not wet." This reasoning is flawed because other factors, like a recent shower, could have made the streets wet.
    
3.  Fallacy of composition: Inferring that what is true for the parts must also be true for the whole. For example: "Each player in the team is skilled, so the entire team must be skilled." This reasoning is flawed because individual skills do not guarantee team synergy or overall effectiveness.
    

These are just a few examples of formal fallacies, and there are many more that can occur in different types of logical structures. Understanding formal fallacies helps in constructing and evaluating valid arguments to ensure logical coherence.
