In sociology, dimensions are used to describe and analyze social phenomena. One commonly used framework is the concept of social dimensions, which identifies various dimensions along which society can be analyzed. These dimensions may include social class, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, and others. By examining social phenomena across different dimensions, sociologists can gain insights into social inequality, social stratification, and other aspects of human society.
