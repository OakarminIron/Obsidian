Computational sociology is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles from sociology and computer science to study and understand complex social phenomena using computational methods and tools. 
It leverages computational techniques to analyze large datasets, simulate social processes, and develop models of social interactions and dynamics. 
This approach allows researchers to explore social phenomena that might be challenging to study using traditional sociological methods alone.

Key aspects of computational sociology include:
- [[Data Analysis]]
- Social Network Analysis
- Agent-Based Modeling
- Complex Systems Theory
- Social Simulation
- Opinion Dynamics and Spread of Information
- Urban and Regional Analysis
