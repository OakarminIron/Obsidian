Axiology deals with the role of values in research. It considers questions such as: What values are present in the research process? How do researchers' values impact the research design, data collection, and interpretation? Axiological perspectives can range from value-neutral approaches, where researchers strive for objectivity and minimize personal biases, to value-laden approaches, where researchers acknowledge and embrace the influence of values on the research process and recognize the importance of subjectivity and reflexivity.
