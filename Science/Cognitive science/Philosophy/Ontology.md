Ontology focuses on the nature of reality and the existence of entities or phenomena being studied. It explores questions such as: What is the nature of reality? What entities or constructs exist in the world? Are there objective truths or multiple subjective realities? Ontological perspectives can range from objectivism, which assumes that there is an objective reality that can be studied and understood independently of human perception, to relativism, which argues that reality is subjective and varies across individuals or social groups.
