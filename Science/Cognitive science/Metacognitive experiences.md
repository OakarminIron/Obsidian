Researchers have defined metacognitive experiences from different perspectives.

Metacognitive experiences refer to what an individual goes through during the cognitive process, that is, the individual's “online” metacognitive knowledge, ideas, beliefs, feelings, goals, and judgments ([Efklides, 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B19)).

[Flavell (1979)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B33) defined metacognitive experiences as any kind of affective and cognitive experience but did not elaborate on the subcategories of metacognitive experiences.
[Efklides (2001)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B19) developed [Flavell (1979)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B33) work by teasing out various aspects of metacognitive experiences in the psychological domain. Metacognitive experiences comprise metacognitive feelings, metacognitive judgments/estimates, and online task-specific knowledge ([Efklides, 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B19)), a composition which is relevant to monitoring and regulating the cognitive process. 

As [Tarricone (2011)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B67) states, metacognitive experiences are conscious cognitive and affective experiences, including “awareness, unexpected awareness, thoughts, intuitions, perceptions, feelings and self-judgements of oneself as a cognisor during problem-solving and task completion” (p. 130). Metacognitive experiences are online, that is, occurring during the cognitive process, and specific, occurring in the interface between particular individuals and specific tasks. The adjective “online” distinguishes metacognitive knowledge and strategies that occur spontaneously within metacognitive experiences from the metacognitive knowledge and strategies that make up the solid foundation of learning. The difference between metacognitive knowledge and online metacognitive knowledge includes the fact that metacognitive knowledge is sustained within long term memory whereas online knowledge occurs within working memory.
