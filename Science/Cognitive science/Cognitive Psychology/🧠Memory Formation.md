1.  [[ðŸ§ Encoding]]: Information from the external world is received and encoded in the brain through various sensory systems (such as sight, sound, and touch). The brain converts this incoming information into neural codes that can be processed and stored.
2.  [[ðŸ§ Consolidation]]: After encoding, memories are gradually stabilized and strengthened through a process called consolidation. This process involves the transfer of information from short-term memory to long-term memory. Consolidation can occur over time or be facilitated by factors such as repetition, emotional significance, and sleep.
3.  [[ðŸ§ Retrieval]]: When we want to recall a memory, the brain retrieves and reconstructs the stored information. Retrieval can be influenced by various factors, such as context, cues, and the strength of the memory.
