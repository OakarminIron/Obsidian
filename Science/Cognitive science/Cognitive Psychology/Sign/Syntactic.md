Syntactics is the study of the logic and grammar of sign systems. Syntactics is devoted to the study of the physical form rather than the content of signs.

• Designation. The designation of a sign refers to the symbol (or collection of symbols) by which some concept is known. The designation of a sign is sometimes referred to as the `signifier` – that which is signifying something

•Extension.The extension of a sign refers to the range of phenomena that the concept in some way cover. The extension is sometimes known as the referent or the signified – that which is being signified.
•Intention. The intention of a sign is the collection of properties that in some ways characteristic the phenomena in the extension. The intention is the idea of significance 

The designation or symbols are equivalent to data in the classic language of information systems. A datum, a single item of data, is a set of symbols used to represent something. Information particularly occurs in the ‘stands-for’ relation between the designation and its intention, and the intention and its extension.
