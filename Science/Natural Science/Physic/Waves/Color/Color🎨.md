Colour is a visual perception that allows us to distinguish different wavelengths of light. It is the result of the interaction between light, objects, and our eyes. When light hits an object, certain wavelengths are absorbed by the object, while others are reflected or transmitted. The reflected or transmitted light then enters our eyes, where it is detected by specialised cells called cones in the retina.
