[[CMYK]]: Stands for cyan, magenta, and yellow. It applies to painting and printing.  
The `CMYK` model is a subtraction model, meaning that colours are created through absorbing wavelengths of visible light. 
The wavelengths of light that donâ€™t get absorbed are reflected, and that reflected light ends up being the colour we see.
[[RGB]] stands for red, green, and blue. It applies to computers, televisions, and electronics. 
The `RGB` model is an additive model, meaning that colours are created through light waves that are added together in particular combinations in order to produce colours.
