[[Mechanical waves]]: These waves require a medium through which to travel, such as air, water, or solid materials. Examples include sound waves, seismic waves, and ocean waves.
 
 [[Matter waves]]: These waves are associated with the movement of particles and include waves in solids, liquids, and gases. Examples include de Broglie waves, which are associated with the movement of particles such as electrons and atoms.
     
[[ Gravitational waves]]: These waves are associated with the movement of massive objects and are caused by the acceleration of these objects. These waves were predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity and were first detected by the LIGO observatory in 2015.

[[ Torsional waves]]: These are mechanical waves that oscillate around an axis. They are observed in solid, liquid and gaseous materials, and they are characterized by a rotation around a fixed point.

[[  Quantum waves]]: These are associated with the behavior of subatomic particles such as electrons and protons. They are described by wave-particle duality and are described by wave functions.
