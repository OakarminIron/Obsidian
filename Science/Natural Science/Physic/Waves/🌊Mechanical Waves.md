[[ðŸŒŠElectromagnetic Waves]]: These waves do not require a medium to travel through and include light, radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.

- [[ðŸŒŠSound]] waves: These are longitudinal waves that require a medium to travel through, such as air or water. They are created by the vibration of an object and are detected by the ear.
- Seismic waves: These are waves that travel through the Earth and are created by events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. They include P-waves, S-waves, and surface waves.
- Ocean waves: These are created by the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean and are a combination of both transverse and longitudinal waves.
- Torsional waves: These are mechanical waves that oscillate around an axis. They are observed in solid, liquid and gaseous materials, and they are characterized by a rotation around a fixed point.
- [[ðŸŒŠLongitudinal Waves]]: are mechanical waves that propagate parallel to the direction of oscillation of the medium, they are observed in solids, liquids and gases. Examples include sound waves and pressure waves.
- Transverse waves: are mechanical waves that oscillate perpendicular to the direction of oscillation of the medium, they are observed in solids, liquids and gases. Examples include waves on a string, waves on water surface.
