[[🌊Mechanical Waves]]: These waves require a medium through which to travel, such as air, water, or solid materials. Examples include sound waves, seismic waves, and ocean waves.
[[🌊Matter Waves]]: These waves are associated with the movement of particles and include waves in solids, liquids, and gases. Examples include `de Broglie waves`, which are associated with the movement of particles such as electrons and atoms.
[[🌊Gravitational Waves]]: These waves are associated with the movement of massive objects and are caused by the acceleration of these objects. 
[[🌊Torsional Waves]]: These are mechanical waves that oscillate around an axis. They are observed in solid, liquid and gaseous materials, and they are characterised by a rotation around a fixed point.
[[🌊Quantum Waves]]: These are associated with the behaviour of subatomic particles such as electrons and protons. They are described by wave-particle duality and are described by wave functions.
