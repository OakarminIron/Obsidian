- Skewness, in statistics, is the degree of asymmetry observed in a probability distribution.
- Distributions can exhibit right (positive) skewness or left (negative) skewness to varying degrees. A normal distribution (bell curve) exhibits zero skewness.
- Investors note right-skewness when judging a return distribution because it, like excess kurtosis, better represents the extremes of the data set rather than focusing solely on the average.
- Skewness informs users of the direction of outliers, though it does not tell users the number of outliers.
- Skewness is often found in stock market returns as well as the distribution of average individual income.
- In addition, a distribution can have a zero skew. Zero skew occurs when a data graph is symmetrical. Regardless of how long or fat the distribution tails are, a zero skew indicates a normal distribution of data.
