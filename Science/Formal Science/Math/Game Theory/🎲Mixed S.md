Mixed strategies
- Unlike pure strategies, mixed strategies involve randomisation. 
- This adds an element of surprise and can be strategically advantageous against opponents who rely on predicting your fixed choices. Like `D&D` game or karma ကံ
- Example: In the left-right game, you could mix your strategy by going left with 60% probability and right with 40%, making it harder for your opponent to guess your next move.
