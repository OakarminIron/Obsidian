[[Constant Sum]]
[[Zero Sum]]
[[Non-Zero Sum]]

Constant sum game is the one in which the sum of outcome of all the players remains constant even if the outcomes are different. Zero sum game is a type of constant sum game in which the sum of outcomes of all players is zero. In zero sum game, the strategies of different players cannot affect the available resources.

Moreover, in zero sum game, the gain of one player is always equal to the loss of the other player. On the other hand, non-zero sum game are the games in which sum of the outcomes of all the players is not zero.

A non-zero sum game can be transformed to zero sum game by adding one dummy player. The losses of dummy player are overridden by the net earnings of players. Examples of zero sum games are chess and gambling. In these games, the gain of one player results in the loss of the other player. However, cooperative games are the example of non-zero games. This is because in cooperative games, either every player wins or loses.
