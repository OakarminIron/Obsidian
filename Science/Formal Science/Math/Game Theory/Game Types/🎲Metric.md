
In [[ðŸŽ²Symmetric]] games, strategies adopted by all players are same. Symmetry can exist in short-term games only because in long-term games the number of options with a player increases. The decisions in a symmetric game depend on the strategies used, not on the players of the game. Even in case of interchanging players, the decisions remain the same in symmetric games. Example of symmetric games is prisonerâ€™s dilemma.

On the other hand, [[ðŸŽ²Asymmetric]] games are the one in which strategies adopted by players are different. In asymmetric games, the strategy that provides benefit to one player may not be equally beneficial for the other player. However, decision making in asymmetric games depends on the different types of strategies and decision of players. Example of asymmetric game is entry of new organization in a market because different organizations adopt different strategies to enter in the same market.
