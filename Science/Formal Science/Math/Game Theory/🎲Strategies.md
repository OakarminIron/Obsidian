not to confuse with ðŸŽ²Game Types


- Pure strategies are the building blocks of mixed strategies. 
	- You can create a mixed strategy by assigning probabilities to your pure strategies.
- Information sets influence which pure strategies are relevant. 
	- In limited information games, your available pure strategies at each decision point depend on what information you have in your current information set.
- Strategies are chosen to maximise expected payoff. 
	- You consider the potential payoffs from different strategies, taking into account both your pure and mixed options, as well as the information you have in your current information set.
