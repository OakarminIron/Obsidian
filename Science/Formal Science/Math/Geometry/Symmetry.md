Symmetry is an important concept in design, art, mathematics, and nature. Many patterns incorporate elements of symmetry, as symmetrical arrangements often create a visually pleasing and aesthetically appealing effect. However, not all patterns are necessarily symmetrical, as patterns can also be based on other principles, such as repetition, alternation, or variation.
