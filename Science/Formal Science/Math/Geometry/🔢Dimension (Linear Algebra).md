Where the traditional geometry allowed dimensions 1 (a line), 2 (a plane) and 3 (space), mathematicians and physicists have used higher dimensions for nearly two centuries.In mathematics, dimension refers to the number of coordinates or independent variables needed to describe a space or object. It measures the "size" of a space in terms of its degrees of freedom. For example, a point in a two-dimensional space requires two coordinates (x, y), while a point in a three-dimensional space requires three coordinates (x, y, z). In higher mathematics, such as topology, dimensions can be more abstract and can describe properties of geometric spaces.

In the field of data analysis, dimensionality refers to the number of features or attributes used to describe a dataset. It is often associated with the term "dimensionality reduction," which aims to reduce the number of features while retaining the most relevant information.
