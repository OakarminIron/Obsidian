Logical construction is the process of organizing information or arguments in a logical and coherent manner, typically for the purpose of making a clear and convincing case or argument. This involves arranging ideas and evidence in a way that follows a logical sequence, and using logical reasoning and structure to support a conclusion or main point. Logical construction is important in many areas of communication and critical thinking, as it helps to ensure that arguments and points are clear, well-organized, and easy to follow.

Logical construction is closely related to [[Logical Structures]], which refers to the way that information or arguments are organized and arranged in a logical way. Logical structure involves creating a clear and coherent structure for ideas, arguments, or information, and organizing them in a way that follows a logical sequence and supports a main point or conclusion. This can include using techniques such as outlining, bullet points, headings, and subheadings to organize information and ideas, and using logical connectors such as "therefore," "however," and "despite" to connect and relate different ideas. Together, logical construction and logical structure help to ensure that information and arguments are clear, coherent, and easy to follow.
