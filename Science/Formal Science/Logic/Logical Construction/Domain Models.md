Domain models are representations or abstractions of the concepts, entities, relationships, and behaviours that exist within a specific application domain. 
They capture the essential aspects of the [[ðŸ¤ŒDomain]] and provide a shared understanding among stakeholders.
Domain models can take different forms, such as conceptual models, class diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, or domain-specific languages.
These models help in visualising and organising the knowledge about the domain, serving as a foundation for the development of software systems within that domain.
