Logical structure refers to the way that information or arguments are organized and arranged in a logical way. This can include the order in which ideas or arguments are presented, as well as the way that they are related to one another. The goal of logical structure is to create a clear and coherent structure for ideas or arguments, and to organize them in a way that follows a logical sequence and supports a main point or conclusion.

There are many ways to create a logical structure for information or arguments. One common approach is to use an outline, which involves dividing the information or arguments into main points or sections, and then subdividing these points into smaller, more specific ideas or points. Another approach is to use headings and subheadings to organize information, which can help to break up large blocks of text and make it easier to follow.

In addition to organizing information or arguments in a logical way, it is also important to use logical connectors such as "therefore," "however," and "despite" to connect and relate different ideas. This helps to create coherence and clarity in the structure of the information or argument, and makes it easier for the reader or listener to follow and understand the main points being made.
