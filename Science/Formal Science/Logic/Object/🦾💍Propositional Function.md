As the name suggests, propositional functions are functions that have propositions as their values. Propositional functions have played an important role in modern logic, from their beginnings in Frege's theory of concepts and their analyses in Russell's works, to their appearance in very general guise in contemporary type theory and categorical grammar.

As a mathematical function, A(x) or A(x1, x2, ..., xn), the propositional function is abstracted from predicates or propositional forms.

As an example, consider the predicate scheme, "x is hot". The substitution of any entity for x will produce a specific proposition that can be described as either true or false, even though "x is hot" on its own has no value as either a true or false statement. 
However, when a value is assigned to x , such as lava, the function then has the value true; while one assigns to x a value like ice, the function then has the value false.
