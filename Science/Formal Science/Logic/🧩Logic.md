What isÂ Logic 

Logic is the study of correct [[ðŸ§©ðŸ¤”Logical Reasoning (Logical Argument)]]. It includes both formal and informal logic. Formal logic is the science of deductively valid inferences or of logical truths. It is a formal science investigating how conclusions follow from premises in a topic-neutral way. When used as a countable noun, the term "a logic" refers to a logical formal system that articulates a proof system. 

Formal logic contrasts with informal logic, which is associated with informal fallacies, critical thinking, and argumentation theory.
While there is no general agreement on how formal and informal logic are to be distinguished, one prominent approach associates their difference with whether the studied arguments are expressed in formal or informal languages. 
Logic plays a central role in multiple fields, such as philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics.
