
[[🧩☝️First-order Predicate Logic]]  allows us to quantify over individual objects or entities in a domain and to make statements about them using predicates, which are like adjectives that describe properties or relations between entities. For example, "All cats are animals" can be expressed in first-order logic as "For all x, if x is a cat, then x is an animal."

[[🧩✌🏼Second Order Logic]] goes beyond first-order logic by allowing us to quantify over sets of objects or entities in a domain. This means we can make statements that involve all the objects in a set, or subsets of objects. For example, "All sets have a size" can be expressed in second-order logic as "For all P, if P is a set, then there exists a number n such that n is the size of P."

[[🧩🎚Higher Order Logic]] are even more complex, allowing us to quantify over functions or relations between objects. These logics are used in areas such as mathematics and computer science.
