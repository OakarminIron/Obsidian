[[Focused Attention]] Stage: The combining of all feature identifiers to perceive all parts as one whole. This is possible through prior knowledge and cognitive mapping. When an item is seen within a known location and has features that people have knowledge of, then prior knowledge will help bring features all together to make sense of what is perceived. 
The focused attention stage is the stage where we consciously direct our attention to specific stimuli or tasks. It involves selecting and maintaining focus on a particular stimulus while filtering out irrelevant or distracting information. Focused attention allows for detailed processing and analysis of the selected information.
