Pragmatics is the study of the general context and culture of communication or the shared assumptions underlying human understanding. For communication to occur between human beings signs must exist in a context of shared understanding. As we shall see, there must be agreed expectations among a group of people about the symbols and the referents or concepts they signify. Pragmatics is the study of such mutual understanding. Much of pragmatics can be considered as the study of culture â€“ the common expectations underlying human communicative behavior in a particular context.
