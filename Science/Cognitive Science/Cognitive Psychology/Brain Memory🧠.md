The ability to recall information such as list or words, mathematical formulas and definitions.
In simplified terms, the brain's memory system can be divided into two main types of memory: short-term memory (also known as working memory) and long-term memory.

1.  [[ðŸ§ Short-term Memory]]: This is the type of memory that holds information temporarily, allowing us to perform tasks and process information in the present moment. It has limited capacity and is relatively fleeting unless actively rehearsed or transferred to long-term memory. Short-term memory is like the computer's random-access memory (RAM) as it stores information temporarily while we are awake and conscious.
2.  [[ðŸ§ Long-term Memory]]: This type of memory involves the storage of information over an extended period, from minutes to a lifetime. Long-term memory can be further categorized into two sub-types:    
    -   Explicit (declarative) memory: 
	    - This refers to [[ðŸ§ conscious memory]] that can be intentionally recalled and expressed in words. 
	    - It includes episodic memory (specific events, experiences, and their associated emotions) and semantic memory (general knowledge and facts).        
    -   Implicit (non-declarative) memory: 
	    - This type of [[ðŸ§ unconscious memory]] influences our behavior and actions without conscious awareness or verbal expression. 
	    - It includes procedural memory (skills and habits) and various forms of conditioning (such as classical conditioning).
