- The terms "thought" and "thinking" refer to a wide variety of psychological activities.
- In their most common sense, they are understood as conscious processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation.
	This includes various different mental processes, like considering an idea or proposition or judging it to be true. 
- In this sense, **memory and imagination are forms of thought** but *perception is not.*
- In a more restricted sense, only the most paradigmatic cases are considered thought. 
- These involve conscious processes that are conceptual or linguistic and sufficiently abstract, like 
	- judging
	- inferring
	- problem solving, and 
	- deliberating. 

- Sometimes the terms "thought" and "thinking" are understood in a very wide sense as referring to any form of mental process, conscious or unconscious.
