Dualism is a philosophical concept that posits the existence of two fundamental, opposing principles or entities. It suggests that the world or reality can be understood in terms of these opposing pairs, such as good and evil, light and dark, mind and body, or black and white. Perspectives can be found in various philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions.

Furthermore, dualism often resonates with our innate tendency to categorize and make sense of the world around us. It allows for easy comprehension and analysis of ideas by breaking them down into contrasting elements. This can be seen in various aspects of human life, from language (e.g., antonyms) to cultural symbolism (e.g., yin and yang [[☯️Taoism]]).
