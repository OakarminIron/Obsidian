Design, whether for an object, process, or system, is a deliberate and often detailed creation by a thinking agent.
It involves 
 - Intentional Planning
 - Addressing various goals and constraints
 - Considering factors
	 - Aesthetics
	 - Functionality
	 - Economics
	 - Socio-political aspects. 
	
The design process, expressed by the verb "to design," may include direct construction without a prior plan in certain cases, such as in artwork and craft-work. 


Examples of designs range from architectural drawings and circuit diagrams to business process models.
