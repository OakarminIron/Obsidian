Researchers have defined meta-cognitive experiences from different perspectives.

Meta-cognitive experiences refer to what an individual goes through during the cognitive process, that is, the individual's “online” meta-cognitive knowledge, ideas, beliefs, feelings, goals, and judgments ([Efklides, 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B19)).

[Flavell (1979)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B33) defined meta-cognitive experiences as any kind of effective and cognitive experience but did not elaborate on the subcategories of meta-cognitive experiences.
[Efklides (2001)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B19) developed [Flavell (1979)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B33) work by teasing out various aspects of meta-cognitive experiences in the psychological domain. Meta-cognitive experiences comprise meta-cognitive feelings, meta-cognitive judgments/estimates, and online task-specific knowledge ([Efklides, 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B19)), a composition which is relevant to monitoring and regulating the cognitive process. 

As [Tarricone (2011)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.744842/full#B67) states, meta-cognitive experiences are conscious cognitive and effective experiences, including “awareness, unexpected awareness, thoughts, intuitions, perceptions, feelings and self-judgments of oneself as a cognisor during problem-solving and task completion” (p. 130). Meta-cognitive experiences are online, that is, occurring during the cognitive process, and specific, occurring in the interface between particular individuals and specific tasks. The adjective “online” distinguishes meta-cognitive knowledge and strategies that occur spontaneously within meta-cognitive experiences from the meta-cognitive knowledge and strategies that make up the solid foundation of learning. The difference between meta-cognitive knowledge and online meta-cognitive knowledge includes the fact that meta-cognitive knowledge is sustained within long term memory whereas online knowledge occurs within working memory.
