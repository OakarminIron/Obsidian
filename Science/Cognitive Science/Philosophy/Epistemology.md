Epistemology deals with the nature of knowledge and how it can be acquired, validated, and interpreted. It examines questions such as: What is knowledge? How is knowledge produced? What are the sources of knowledge? Epistemological perspectives can range from positivism, which emphasizes objective and scientific knowledge obtained through empirical observation and experimentation, to constructivism, which emphasizes subjective and socially constructed knowledge influenced by individual experiences and social contexts.
