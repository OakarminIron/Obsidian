Moral values are principles or beliefs about what is right or wrong, good or bad, and they guide an individual's behaviour and decision-making based on their sense of morality. 
These values are deeply ingrained and are often shaped by a person's upbringing, culture, religion, and personal experiences. 
Moral values help individuals distinguish between actions or behaviours that they consider ethical and those they deem unethical. 

Some common moral values include:

- [[Honesty]]: The belief in telling the truth and being sincere in all interactions, avoiding deception, lying, or fraud.
- [[Compassion]]: The value of showing kindness, empathy, and sympathy toward others, especially those who are suffering or in need.
- [[Integrity]]: The commitment to maintaining a strong moral and ethical character, even when faced with temptations or difficult choices.
- [[Respect]]: The belief in treating others with consideration, dignity, and fairness, regardless of their background, beliefs, or differences.
- [[Responsibility]]: The sense of duty and accountability for one's actions and their consequences, both personally and within the larger community.
- [[Justice]]: The belief in fairness and equity, ensuring that individuals are treated equitably and that injustices are rectified.
- [[Generosity]]: The willingness to share resources, time, and support with others, especially those who are less fortunate.
- [[Forgiveness]]: The ability to let go of resentment and anger, offering a chance for reconciliation and personal growth.
- [[Courage]]: The willingness to face difficult or morally challenging situations with bravery and conviction.
- [[Loyalty]]: The commitment to stand by and support family, friends, or principles, even in the face of adversity.

Moral values can vary significantly from person to person and culture to culture.
