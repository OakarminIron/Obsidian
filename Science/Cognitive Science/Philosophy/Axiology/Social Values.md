Social values are the shared beliefs, attitudes, and norms that guide and shape the behavior and interactions of individuals within a society or community. 
These values reflect what a society considers important, acceptable, and desirable, and they play a significant role in shaping the culture, customs, and social norms of that society. Social values can vary across different societies and can evolve over time in response to changes in social, economic, and cultural factors.

Social values serve as a framework for societal cohesion and cooperation, influencing social interactions, laws, policies, and institutions. They help guide individuals in making choices that are in line with the expectations and norms of their society. Additionally, social values can change over time due to shifts in cultural, economic, political, and technological factors, leading to evolving societal norms and attitudes. Understanding and respecting the social values of a particular society is crucial for effective communication, cooperation, and integration within that community.
