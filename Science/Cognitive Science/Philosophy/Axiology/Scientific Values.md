Scientific values are principles and standards that guide the practice of science, the pursuit of knowledge, and the conduct of scientific research. 
These scientific values collectively contribute to the reliability, credibility, and progress of scientific research. 
They help ensure that scientific findings are based on evidence rather than personal beliefs, biases, or dogma.
Adherence to these values promotes the growth of human knowledge and the advancement of science as a discipline.
These values are essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the scientific process and for ensuring that scientific investigations produce credible and trustworthy results. Some of the key scientific values include:

[[Empiricism]]: The core of scientific inquiry is empirical observation and experimentation. Scientific values emphasize the reliance on evidence obtained through systematic observation and data collection.
[[Objectivity]]: Scientists strive to maintain objectivity in their research, meaning they aim to minimize personal biases and emotions that could influence the interpretation of data or the formulation of hypotheses.
[[Falsifiability]]: Scientific hypotheses and theories should be formulated in a way that allows for the possibility of being tested and potentially falsified through empirical evidence. This principle is central to the philosophy of science.
[[Skepticism]]: A healthy degree of skepticism is valued in science. Scientists are encouraged to question assumptions, challenge existing theories, and critically evaluate the work of others.
[[Transparency]]: Scientific values promote openness and transparency in research methods, data collection, and reporting. This transparency allows other scientists to replicate experiments and validate findings.
[[Reproducibility]]: Scientific studies should be designed in a way that allows other researchers to replicate the experiments and obtain similar results, which is a cornerstone of scientific reliability.
[[Peer Review]]: Scientific research typically undergoes peer review, where experts in the field assess the quality and validity of research before it is published. This process helps ensure the accuracy and credibility of scientific findings.
[[Ethical Conduct]]: Scientists are expected to conduct research with integrity and adhere to ethical guidelines. This includes obtaining informed consent from research participants, avoiding plagiarism, and disclosing conflicts of interest.
[[Cumulative Nature]]: Scientific values recognize that scientific knowledge is cumulative, building on previous research and continually evolving as new evidence and insights emerge.
[[Universality]]: Scientific values are not bound by geography, culture, or personal belief. They aim to produce knowledge that is universally applicable and verifiable.
[[Public Engagement]]: Scientists are encouraged to engage with the public and communicate their findings in an accessible manner, fostering scientific literacy and understanding.
[[Hypothesis-Driven]]: Scientific inquiry is often hypothesis-driven, meaning that researchers formulate testable hypotheses and design experiments to investigate them systematically.
