[[Multimodal learning]]
Fleming claimed that not everyone has one defined preferred modality of learning; some people may have a mixture that makes up their preferred learning style.

VARK type two learners need to receive input or output in all of their preferred styles. They will continue to work until all preferred learning areas have been met .
