Electromagnetic waves are a type of mechanical wave, but they have some unique properties that set them apart from other types of mechanical waves such as sound waves. Electromagnetic waves do not require a medium to travel through and can travel through a vacuum, such as through space. They are created by the oscillation of electric and magnetic fields and can have a wide range of frequencies, from radio waves to gamma rays. Light, specifically, falls in the visible spectrum of the electromagnetic waves and is the type of wave that we perceive as light and that our eyes can detect.
