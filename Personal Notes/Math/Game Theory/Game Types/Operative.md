[[Cooperative]]
[[Non-Cooperative]]
Cooperative games are the one in which players are convinced to adopt a particular strategy through negotiations and agreements between players. Let us take the example cited in prisoner’s dilemma to understand the concept of cooperative games. In case, John and Mac had been able to contact each other, then they must have decided to remain silent. Therefore, their negotiation would have helped in solving out the problem.

Another example can be cited for pan masala organizations. Suppose pan masala organizations have high ad-expenditure that they want to reduce. However, they are not sure whether other organizations would follow them or not.

This creates a situation of dilemma among pan masala organizations. However, the government restricts the advertisement of pan masala on televisions. This would help in reducing the ad-expenditure of pan masala organizations. This is an example of cooperative game.
However, non-cooperative games refer to the games in which the players decide on their own strategy to maximize their profit. The best example of a non-cooperative game is prisoner’s dilemma. Non-cooperative games provide accurate results. This is because in non-cooperative games, a very deep analysis of a problem takes place.
