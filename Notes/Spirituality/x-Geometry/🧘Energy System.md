In `esotericism` we have to recognise that the human body has an [[🧘Energy Field Aura]] around it, which has its own north-south axis. As we move around, the angle formed between our individual axis and that of the earth is constantly changing, and this in turn either strengthens or weakens our energy field. The positive range is very small, vulnerable most of the time, and is a major factor affecting our health and well being. 

In yoga, Indian medicine and Indian martial arts, `prāṇa` (प्राण,the Sanskrit word for breath, "life force", or "vital principle") permeates reality on all levels including inanimate objects. In Hindu literature, `prāṇa` is sometimes described as originating from the Sun and connecting the elements.

Five types of `prāṇa`, collectively known as the five `vāyus` ("winds"), are described in Hindu texts. Ayurveda, tantra and Tibetan medicine all describe `prāṇa vāyu` as the basic `vāyu` from which the other `vāyus` arise.

`Prana` is divided into ten main functions: The five `Pranas` – `Prana, Apana, Udana, Vyana and Samana` – and the five `Upa-Pranas – Naga, Kurma, Devadatta, Krikala and Dhananjaya.` `Pranayama`, one of the eight limbs of yoga, is intended to expand `prana`.

In Melanesian and Polynesian cultures, `mana` is a supernatural force that permeates the universe.Anyone or anything can have `mana`. They believed it to be a cultivation or possession of energy and power, rather than being a source of power. It is an intentional force. `Mana` has been discussed mostly in relation to cultures of Polynesia, but also of Melanesia, notably the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.

In traditional Chinese culture and the East Asian cultural sphere, [[Qi]], also ch'i or chi, is believed to be a vital force forming part of any living entity. Literally meaning "`vapor`", "air", or "breath", the word `qi` is often translated as "vital energy", "vital force", "material energy", or simply as "energy".
