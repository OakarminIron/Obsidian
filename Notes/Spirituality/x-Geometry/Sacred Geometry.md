Sacred geometry is essentially **the study of the spiritual meaning of various shapes**. It can be applied to the forms, numbers, and patterns seen throughout the natural world. The spiral of a snail's shell, the captivating pattern of a single snowflake, and the branches of a tree can all be examples of sacred geometry.
