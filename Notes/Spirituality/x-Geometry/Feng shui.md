`Feng shui` is an ancient Chinese traditional practice which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment. The term `feng shui` means, literally, "wind-water" (i.e. fluid). From ancient times, landscapes and bodies of water were thought to direct the flow of the universal [[Qi]] – "cosmic current" or energy – through places and structures. More broadly, `feng shui` includes astronomical, astrological, architectural, cosmological, geographical and topographical dimensions
