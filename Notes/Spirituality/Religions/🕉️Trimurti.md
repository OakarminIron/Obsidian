The Trimurti is a concept in Hinduism representing three major cosmic functions which represent Process State:

[[🕉️Brahma]]: The creator god responsible for creating the universe.
[[🕉️Vishnu]]: The preserver god who maintains cosmic order and incarnates to protect righteousness.
[[🕉️Shiva]]: The destroyer god who dissolves , paving the way for its recreation.
Together, they symbolize the cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction in Hindu cosmology.
