It was originated by `Alan Robert Krakower` who published a book called `The Human Design System under the pseudonym Ra Uru Hu` in 1992. `Krakower` developed the Human Design system following a mystical experience in 1987. Human Design purports to be a self-knowledge method which does not have any specific religious dogma or affiliation.Despite this, it has been described by `theologian J. R. Hustwit` as a `transreligious project` that is "breathtaking in scope" and synthesizes seven or more traditions. It has also been described as a psychological counseling instrument and "the new astrology."
