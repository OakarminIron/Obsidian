In economics and finance, the term "temperature" is sometimes metaphorically used to describe the state of financial markets or economic conditions. 
It reflects the overall activity, volatility, or stability.
A hot market may refer to a period of high activity and rising prices, while a cool market may indicate lower activity and stability.
