
Once an organization-wide commitment has been secured from all departments involved in the re-engineering effort and at different levels, 
the critical step of selecting a BPR team must be taken. 
This team will form the nucleus of the BPR effort, 
make key decisions and recommendations, and help communicate the details and benefits of the BPR program to the entire organization.
The determinants of an effective BPR team may be summarized as follows:

- competency of the members of the team, their motivation
- their credibility within the organization and their creativity
- team empowerment, training of members in process mapping and brainstorming techniques
- effective team [[leadership]]
- proper organization of the team
- complementary skills among team members, adequate size, interchangeable accountability, clarity of work approach, and
- specificity of goals. (ပါစင်နယ် Value တွေGoals တွေ)

The most effective BPR teams include active representatives from the following work groups:
- top management
- the business area responsible for the process being addressed
- technology groups
- finance
- Members of all ultimate process users' groups.

Team members who are selected from each work group within the organization will affect the outcome of the re engineered process according to their desired requirements. The BPR team should be mixed in-depth and knowledge. 

For example, it may include members with the following characteristics:
- Members who do not know the process at all. (ဘာမှမသိတဲ့သူ)
- Members who know the process inside-out. (အူမချေးခါး အကုန်သိ)
- Customers, if possible. (Internal or External)
- Members representing affected departments.
- One or two members of the best, brightest, passionate, and committed technology experts.(ဖိုးညာဏ်ကောင်း မယ်ညာဏ်ကောင်းများ)
- Members from outside of the organization
