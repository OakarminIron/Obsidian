A Dataset is a set or collection of data that pertain to a specific topic[[üåêDomain]].
This set is normally presented in a tabular pattern. 

Every column describes a particular variable. 
And each row corresponds to a given member of the data set, as per the given question.

- Numerical Datasets: Numerical datasets consist of quantitative data expressed in [[üî£Real Numbers]], allowing arithmetic operations. Examples include the weight and height of a person, the count of red blood cells in a medical report, and the number of pages in a book.
- `Bivariate` Datasets: Involve two variables, exploring their [[Relationship]]. For instance, analyzing the percentage score and age of students in a class or studying the sales of ice cream in relation to the temperature on a given day.
- Multivariate Datasets (Tables):Multivariate datasets comprise three or more variables.
- Categorical Datasets: represent features or characteristics and involve categorical variables, such as a person's gender (male or female) or marital status (married/unmarried).
- Correlation Datasets: Demonstrate relationships between values. Positive correlation implies variables move in the same direction, negative correlation indicates opposite movement, and zero correlation signifies no relationship. For instance, the correlation between weight and height, where taller individuals are generally heavier.
