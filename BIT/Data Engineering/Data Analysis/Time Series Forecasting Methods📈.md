 

- [[Auto Regression]] (AR): AR is a time series analysis technique that predicts future values based on a linear relationship with its past observations, leveraging patterns in historical data for forecasting.
- [[Moving Averages]]: Moving averages reduce fluctuations and reveal trends in time series data by calculating the average of successive data points over a specified period, aiding in forecasting by smoothing noise and emphasising long-term patterns.
- [[ARIMA]] (Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average): `ARIMA` is a powerful time series forecasting technique that combines auto-regression, differentiating, and moving averages to capture trends and seasonality, providing flexibility for various types of time series analyses.
- [[SARIMA]] (Seasonal Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average): `SARIMA` is an extension of `ARIMA` designed to address time series data with seasonal patterns, incorporating auto-regressive, differentiating, moving average, and seasonal components for comprehensive analysis and forecasting.
- [[ProphetðŸ“ˆ]]: Prophet, developed by Facebook, is a forecasting tool for time series analysis, known for its user-friendly interface and ability to handle daily observations. It incorporates seasonality, holidays, and events for precise and adaptable forecasts, requiring minimal `preprocessing`.
- [[Exponential Smoothing]]: Exponential smoothing is a time series forecasting method assigning varying weights to past observations, with greater emphasis on recent data. It includes simple exponential smoothing (`SES`), double exponential smoothing (Holt's method), and triple exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters method), widely applied in finance, inventory management, and demand forecasting for its simplicity and effectiveness.
