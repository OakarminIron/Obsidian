- [[Numerical Datasets]]: Numerical datasets consist of quantitative data expressed in ðŸ”£Real Numbers, allowing arithmetic operations. Examples include the weight and height of a person, the count of red blood cells in a medical report, and the number of pages in a book.
- [[Bivariate Datasets]]: Involve two variables, exploring their Relationship. For instance, analysing the percentage score and age of students in a class or studying the sales of ice cream in relation to the temperature on a given day.
- [[Multivariate Datasets]] (Tables):Multivariate datasets comprise three or more variables.
- [[Categorical Datasets]]: represent features or characteristics and involve categorical variables, such as a person's gender (male or female) or marital status (married/unmarried).
- [[Correlation Datasets]]: Demonstrate relationships between values.
	- Positive correlation implies variables move in the same direction
	- Negative correlation indicates opposite movement, and zero correlation signifies no relationship. 
	- For instance, the correlation between weight and height, where taller individuals are generally heavier.
