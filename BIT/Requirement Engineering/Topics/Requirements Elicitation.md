Requirement elicitation is the process of communicating and collaborating with key stakeholders to assemble the insight and identify the project's needs.

This involves identifying, understanding, and capturing the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders. Techniques such as interviews, workshops, surveys, and observations are used to elicit requirements from various stakeholders. The goal is to gather comprehensive and accurate information about the desired system.
