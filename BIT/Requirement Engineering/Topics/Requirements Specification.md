Requirement specification refers to the process of documenting the requirements in a clear, unambiguous, and structured manner. It involves translating the gathered requirements into a formal document or specification that serves as a reference for the development team and other stakeholders.

The requirement specification serves as a contract between the stakeholders and the development team, guiding the development process and providing a basis for testing, verification, and validation. It is a critical deliverable in requirement engineering that ensures a common understanding of the system's requirements and facilitates effective communication among all parties involved.

The requirement specification typically includes various sections and components to provide a comprehensive understanding of the requirements. Some common elements found in a requirement specification document are:

1. [[Functional Requirements]]: These describe the specific functionalities or features that the system or software should possess. They outline what the system is expected to do in terms of its behavior, operations, and interactions with users or other systems.    
2. [[Non-Functional Requirements]]: These specify the quality attributes and constraints of the system, such as performance, scalability, security, reliability, usability, and maintainability. Non-functional requirements focus on how the system should behave in terms of its characteristics and constraints.    
3. [[Use Cases or User Stories]]: Use cases or user stories provide detailed descriptions of how users interact with the system to achieve specific goals. They typically describe the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and the system, capturing the flow of events and the expected outcomes.    
4. [[Data Requirements]]: This section defines the data entities, their attributes, relationships, and constraints within the system. It specifies the data that needs to be captured, stored, processed, and presented by the system.    
5. [[Constraints and Assumptions]]: These include any limitations, dependencies, or assumptions that impact the requirements or the design and implementation of the system. It is important to document these constraints and assumptions to ensure a clear understanding among stakeholders.    
6. [[Acceptance Criteria]]: These criteria outline the conditions that must be met for the stakeholders to accept and approve the delivered system or software. Acceptance criteria help in validating and verifying whether the system meets the specified requirements.
