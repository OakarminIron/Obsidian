[[Stakeholder issues]]

Steve McConnell, in his book _Rapid Development_, details a number of ways users can inhibit requirements gathering:

-   Users do not understand what they want or users don't have a clear idea of their requirements ကိုယ်ဘာလိုချင်မှန်းမသိ
-   Users will not commit to a set of written requirements လိုချင်တာကိုမပြော
-   Users insist on new requirements after the cost and schedule have been fixed ဖြတ်ပြီးမှထပ်လိုချင်
-   Communication with users is slow မဆက်သွယ်
-   Users often do not participate in reviews or are incapable of doing so မထုံတက်တေး
-   Users are technically unsophisticated နည်းပညာနားမလည်
-   Users do not understand the development process လုပ်နေတာကိုနားမလည်
-   Users do not know about present technology နည်းပညာနဲ့၀ေး

This may lead to the situation where user requirements keep changing even when system or product development has been started.

[[Engineer/Developer issues]]

Possible problems caused by engineers and developers during requirements analysis are:

-   A natural inclination towards writing code can lead to implementation beginning before the requirements analysis is complete, potentially resulting in code changes to meet actual requirements once they are known. နားမလည်ခင် ဆောက်ရမ်းရေးချင်
-   Technical personnel and end-users may have different vocabularies. Consequently, they may wrongly believe they are in perfect agreement until the finished product is supplied. အချင်းချင်းနားလည်မှုလွဲ
-   Engineers and developers may try to make the requirements fit an existing system or model, rather than develop a system specific to the needs of the client. ဖြစ်သင့်တာထက် ဖြစ်နေတဲ့အရှုပ်ထုပ်ကိုပုံပြောင်းလုပ်
