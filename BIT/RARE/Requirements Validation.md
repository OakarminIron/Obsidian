Requirements validation is the process of evaluating and verifying the collected requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and feasible. Validation techniques such as reviews, inspections, and walk-through are used to identify any errors, ambiguities, or contradictions in the requirements. This helps ensure that the requirements accurately represent the stakeholders' needs and can be implemented effectively.
