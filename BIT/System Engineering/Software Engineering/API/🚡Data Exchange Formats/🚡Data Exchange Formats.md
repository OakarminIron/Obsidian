A data exchange format is a standardized way to structure and represent data when it is exchanged or transmitted between different systems or applications. It defines rules and syntax for encoding data so that it can be easily understood and interpreted by both the sender and receiver.

Popular data exchange formats include:

- [[JSON]] 
- [[XML]]
- [[CSV]]
- [[Protocol Buffers]]
- [[YAML]] 

These are just a few examples of popular data exchange formats. The choice of format depends on factors such as the requirements of the systems involved, ease of parsing and generation, interoperability, and readability.
