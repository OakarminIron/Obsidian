[[REST API]] vs [[SOAP API]]

| SOAP API                                                       | REST API                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Relies on SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)                 | Relies on REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture using HTTP.                                                                              |
| Transports data in standard XML format.                        | Generally transports data in JSON. It is based on URI. Because REST follows stateless model, REST does not enforces message format as XML or JSON etc. |
| Because it is XML based and relies on SOAP, it works with WSDL | It works with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE                                                                                                                   |
| Works over HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, XMPP                             | Works over HTTP and HTTPS                                                                                                                              |
| Highly structured/typed                                        | Less structured -> less bulky data                                                                                                                     |
| Designed with large enterprise applications in mind            | Designed with mobile devices in mind                                                                                                                   |
