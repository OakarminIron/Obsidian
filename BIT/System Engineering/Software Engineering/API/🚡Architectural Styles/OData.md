 Open Data Protocol is a protocol for building and consuming `RESTful` APIs.
 It provides conventions for querying and manipulating data, supports CRUD operations, and enables clients to discover and navigate related resources.
  `OData` includes a query language that allows clients to filter, sort, and paginate data from `RESTful` APIs. 
  It follows a uniform convention for querying resources, supporting operations such as filtering based on criteria, sorting, and data aggregation.
