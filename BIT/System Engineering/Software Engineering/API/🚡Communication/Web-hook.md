A server-side, event-driven mechanism.
It sends HTTP callbacks (usually POST requests) when specific events occur, perfect for real-time data updates or third-party service integration.
When an event of interest happens, the originating application sends an HTTP request (often a POST request) to a predefined URL (the web-hook URL) on the receiving application.
