Server sent events(SSE) is a pushing technology that enables pushing notification/message/events from the server to the client(s) via HTTP connection.
One Way Messaging
Server-Sent Events (SSE) are based on Server-Sent DOM Events. Browsers can subscribe to a stream of events generated by a server using the EventSource interface, receiving updates whenever a new event occurs. EventSource accepts an HTTP event stream connection from a specific URL and keeps the connection open while retrieving available data. Server-sent events are pushed (rather than pulled, or requested) from a server to a browser.


Summary of key Server-Sent Events features
- Uses XHR streaming to transport messages over HTTP.
- Connection is one-way, so SSEs are useful for apps that only require reading data from the server, such as live stock or news tickers.
- Less complex to implement SSE-based connections, but not many related libraries are available.
- Event-based; no polling required to intercept messages.Server-Sent Events are specified in the HTML specification and have been supported by all major browsers for a number of years. See the Event Source browser support table on MDN for more details.

SERVER-SENT EVENTS ADVANTAGES:
- Polysyllable: Server-Sent Events can be poly-filled with JavaScript in browsers that do not support it yet. This is useful for backward compatibility because you can rely on the existing implementation rather than having to write an alternative.
- Built-in support for re-connection: Server-Sent Event connections will reestablish a connection after it is lost, meaning less code to write to achieve an essential behavior.
- No firewall blocking: SSEs have no trouble with corporate firewalls doing packet inspection, which is important for supporting apps in enterprise settings.

SERVER-SENT EVENTS DISADVANTAGES:
- Data format limitations. Server-Sent Events are limited to transporting UTF-8 messages; binary data is not supported.
- Limited concurrent connections. You can only have six concurrent open SSE connections per browser at any one time. This can be especially painful when you want to open multiple tabs with SSE connections. See 'Server-Sent Events and browser limits' for more information and workaround suggestions.
- SSE is mono-directional. You can only send messages from server to client. While this is useful for creating read-only realtime apps like stock tickers, it is limiting for many other types of realtime app.
