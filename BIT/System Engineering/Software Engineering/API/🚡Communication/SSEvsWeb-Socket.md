[[Server Side Event SSE]] vs [[Web-Socketüåêüîå]]
As communication protocols, SSE and Web-Sockets define the rules and conventions for establishing and maintaining a connection between a client and a server, allowing real-time communication and data transfer.

As communication mechanisms, SSE and Web-Sockets provide specific ways for applications to exchange data and events. They offer different communication patterns and capabilities compared to traditional request-response mechanisms like HTTP.
