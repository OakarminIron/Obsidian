Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on understanding and modeling the domain or problem space of the software application. It emphasizes close collaboration between domain experts and developers to create a shared understanding of the problem domain. DDD aims to align the software design and implementation with the language and concepts used in the domain, resulting in more maintainable and expressive code.
