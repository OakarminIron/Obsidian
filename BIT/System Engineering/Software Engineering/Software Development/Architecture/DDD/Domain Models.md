Domain models are representations or abstractions of the concepts, entities, relationships, and behaviors that exist within a specific application domain. 
They capture the essential aspects of the domain and provide a shared understanding among stakeholders.
Domain models can take different forms, such as conceptual models, class diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, or domain-specific languages.
These models help in visualizing and organizing the knowledge about the domain, serving as a foundation for the development of software systems within that domain.
