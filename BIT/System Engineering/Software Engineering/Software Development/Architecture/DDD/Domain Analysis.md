Domain analysis involves systematically studying and analyzing the characteristics, requirements, and constraints of a specific application domain. It aims to identify the commonalities, variability, and core assets within the domain. Domain analysis involves activities such as domain modeling, domain knowledge acquisition, identification of domain-specific requirements, and identification of reusable components and architectures. The goal is to build a deep understanding of the domain and to leverage this knowledge for efficient and effective software development.
