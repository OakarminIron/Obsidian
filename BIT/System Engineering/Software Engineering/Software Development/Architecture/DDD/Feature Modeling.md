 Feature modeling is a technique used in domain engineering to identify and represent the variability within a family of related software systems. It involves modeling the optional and alternative features that can be selected or excluded in different software products within the domain. Feature modeling helps in managing the [[Variability]], allowing for the efficient configuration and customization of software systems based on specific requirements.
