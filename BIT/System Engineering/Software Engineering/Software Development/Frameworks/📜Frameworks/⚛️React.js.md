Created by [[Facebook]], the React framework has earned popularity very quickly. It is used to develop and operate the dynamic User Interface of web pages with high incoming traffic. It makes use of a Virtual DOM, and hence, integration with any application is more straightforward.

Features:

- Declarative: Creates interactive and dynamic UI for websites and mobile applications. Declarative views make the code readable and easy to debug.
- Virtual DOM: For every DOM object, there is a corresponding "virtual DOM object." It creates a virtual copy of the original DOM and is a representation of a DOM object.
- Event handling: React has its fully compatible W3C object model event system created. It also provides a cross-browser interface to a native event.
- JSX: JSX is a markup syntax that closely resembles HTML. JSX makes writing React components easier by making the syntax almost identical to the HTML injected into the web page.
- Performance: React uses one-way data binding with an application architecture called Flux controls. ReactJS helps update the View for the user with Flux controlling the application workflow.
- React Native: React Native is a custom renderer for React; it uses native components instead of web components like React as building blocks.
- Component-Based: Everything is a component of the web page, divided into small components to create a view(or UIs). Components in ReactJS are used to define the visuals and interactions in applications.
