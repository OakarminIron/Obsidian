- Once the data is in the database, you still need to retrieve it. 
- LangChain supports many different retrieval algorithms and is one of the places where we add the most value. 
- [[Parent Document Retriever]]: This allows you to create multiple embedding per parent document, allowing you to look up smaller chunks but return larger context.
- [[Self Query Retriever]]: User questions often contain a reference to something that isn't just semantic but rather expresses some logic that can best be represented as a metadata filter. Self-query allows you to parse out the semantic part of a query from other metadata filters present in the query.
- [[Ensemble Retriever]]: Sometimes you may want to retrieve documents from multiple different sources, or using multiple different algorithms. The ensemble retriever allows you to easily do this.
- And more!
