- Compatibility = The software is able to operate with other products that are designed for interoperability with another product. For example, a piece of software may be backward-compatible with an older version of itself.
- Extensibility = New capabilities can be added to the software without major changes to the underlying architecture.
- Modularity = the resulting software comprises well defined, independent components which leads to better maintainability. The components could be then implemented and tested in isolation before being integrated to form a desired software system. This allows division of work in a software development project.
- Fault-tolerance = The software is resistant to and able to recover from component failure.
- Maintainability = A measure of how easily bug fixes or functional modifications can be accomplished. High maintainability can be the product of modularity and extensibility.
- Reliability (Software durability) = The software is able to perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.
- Reusability = The ability to use some or all of the aspects of the preexisting software in other projects with little to no modification.
- Robustness = The software is able to operate under stress or tolerate unpredictable or invalid input. For example, it can be designed with resilience to low memory conditions.
- Security = The software is able to withstand and resist hostile acts and influences.
- Usability = The software user interface must be usable for its target user/audience. Default values for the parameters must be chosen so that they are a good choice for the majority of the users.
- Performance = The software performs its tasks within a time-frame that is acceptable for the user, and does not require too much memory.
- Portability = The software should be usable across a number of different conditions and environments.
- Scalability = The software adapts well to increasing data or added features or number of users.
