- [[Adapter Pattern]] allows objects with incompatible interface to collaborate.
- [[Bridge Pattern]] Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related class into two separate hierarchies(abstraction and implementation)
- [[Composite Pattern]] : Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
- [[Decorator Pattern]] : Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by wrapping like Russian doll
- [[Facade Pattern]] : Provide a simplified interface to an library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
- [[Flyweight Pattern]] : Lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.
- [[Proxy Pattern]] : Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
