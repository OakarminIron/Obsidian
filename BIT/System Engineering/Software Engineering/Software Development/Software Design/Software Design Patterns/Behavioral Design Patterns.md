Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

[[Chain of Responsibility Pattern]]: lets you pass request requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

[[Command Pattern]]: Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass request as a method arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undo able operations.

[[Iterator Pattern]] :Lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation ( list, stack, tree, etc)

[[Mediator Pattern]]: Lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.

[[Memento Pattern]]: Lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

[[Observer Pattern]]: Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.

[[State Pattern]]: Lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appear as if the object changed its class.

[[Strategy Pattern]] Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

[[Template Pattern]] Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the super class but lets sub classes override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure

[[Visitor Pattern]] Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
