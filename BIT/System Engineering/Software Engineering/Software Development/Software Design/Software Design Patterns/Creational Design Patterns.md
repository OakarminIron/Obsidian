Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- [[Factory Pattern]] provide an interface for creating objects in a super class, but allows the super class to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- [[Abstract Factory Pattern]] lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete class
- [[Builder Pattern]] lets you construct complex objects step by step. the pattern allows you to produce different types and representation of an object using the same construction code.
- [[Prototype Pattern]] lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
- [[Singleton Pattern]] lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
