Notation, in the context of algorithms and complexity analysis, refers to the [[MathðŸ”£]] symbols and expressions used to represent the performance characteristics of an Algorithm or the growth rate of a function. It provides a concise and standardized way to describe how the running [Time or Space](Time_or_Space_of_Algorithm.md) requirements of an algorithm or function change as the input size increases.

In the field of algorithm analysis, three commonly used notations are 
1. [[Big O Notation (O)]]    
2. [[Omega Notation (Î©)]]    
3. [[Theta Notation (Î˜)]]

These notations are used to describe the growth rates in terms of time complexity or space complexity, but they can also be applied to other measures of efficiency or resources. They are fundamental tools for analyzing and comparing algorithms and help us make informed decisions about algorithm selection based on their efficiency characteristics. Notation allows us to compare and analyze different algorithms or functions in terms of their efficiency and scalability. It helps us understand how an algorithm's performance scales with larger inputs and provides a way to express the best-case, worst-case, or average-case behavior of an algorithm.
