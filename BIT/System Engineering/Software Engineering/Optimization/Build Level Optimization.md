Optimizing the build process of the software. This may involve selecting appropriate build tools, configuring the build environment, and optimizing the build process to minimize build times and reduce resource usage.

- [[Compile Level Optimization]] This level of optimization involves optimizing the compilation process of the software. This can include selecting appropriate compilers, optimizing compiler flags and settings, and optimizing the code generated by the compiler.
- [[Assembly Level Optimization]] This level of optimization involves optimizing the assembly code generated by the compiler. This can include manually optimizing the assembly code to improve performance and reduce resource usage.
