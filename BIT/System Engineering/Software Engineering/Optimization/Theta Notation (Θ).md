Theta notation provides both an upper and lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm or function. It represents a tight bound on the algorithm's performance. If an algorithm has a time complexity of Î˜(n), it means the algorithm's running time grows linearly with the input size, and the growth rate is neither faster nor slower than linear. In other words, it implies both the upper and lower bounds of the algorithm's performance are the same.
