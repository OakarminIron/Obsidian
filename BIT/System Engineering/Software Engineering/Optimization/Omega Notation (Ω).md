Omega notation provides a lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm or function. It represents the best-case scenario, indicating the minimum amount of resources required by the algorithm as a function of the input size. For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of Î©(n), it means the algorithm's running time grows linearly with the input size, or in simpler terms, it takes at least a multiple of n steps to complete.
