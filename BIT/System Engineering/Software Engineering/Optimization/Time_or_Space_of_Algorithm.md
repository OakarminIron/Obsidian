The time requirements of an algorithm or function refer to the amount of time it takes for the algorithm or function to execute or compute a result. It is typically measured in terms of the number of basic [[Thread]] or steps performed by the algorithm as a function of the input size. Time complexity analysis helps us understand how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.

The space requirements of an algorithm or function refer to the amount of [[ðŸ‘»Memory RAM]] or storage space needed to execute the algorithm or function. It includes both the amount of additional memory used for temporary variables, data structures, and the stack space required for function calls. Space complexity analysis helps us understand how the memory usage of an algorithm scales with the input size.

In summary, the time requirements of an algorithm or function describe how long it takes to execute, while the space requirements describe how much memory it needs to execute. Time complexity and space complexity analysis are crucial for understanding the efficiency and resource usage of algorithms and functions, helping us choose the most suitable solutions for specific problem domains and input sizes.
