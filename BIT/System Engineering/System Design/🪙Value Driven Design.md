Value-driven design (`VDD`) is a systems engineering strategy based on [[Micro Economic]] which enables multidisciplinary design optimization. 

Value-driven design is being developed by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, through a program committee of government, industry and academic representatives. In parallel, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has promulgated an identical strategy, calling it value-centric design, on the `F6` Program. At this point, the terms value-driven design and value-centric design are interchangeable. 

The essence  is that design choices are made to maximize [[System Value]] rather than to meet performance requirements.

This is also similar to the value-driven approach of agile software development where a project's stakeholders priorities their high-level needs (or system features) based on the perceived business value each would deliver.
