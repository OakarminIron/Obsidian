Test-Driven Development is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. It follows a cycle of writing a test, running it (which should initially fail), writing the code to pass the test, and then refactoring the code. TDD helps ensure that the software meets the specified requirements and encourages developers to think critically about the design and functionality of their code.
