Behavior-Driven Development is a software development methodology that combines principles of test-driven development with a focus on defining and specifying the expected behaviors of a system in a natural language format. `BDD` aims to improve collaboration and communication among developers, testers, and stakeholders by using a common language to describe system behaviors and requirements.
