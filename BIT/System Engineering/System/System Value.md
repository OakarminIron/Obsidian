
The value derived from the efficient and effective functioning of a larger system.
The value of the system lies in its ability to produce outcomes that are greater than the sum of its individual parts.

```stakeholders
System Value is based on the preferences of the stakeholders. These preferences are captured mathematically in a system value model and enable the preferences of different stakeholders to be compared and conflicts or contradictions resolved. This forms the value basis of the system.
```

```cost
System Cost is an important aspect in the system value, both the development cost and the operational cost. Cost models are specific to the system (Principle 1) and should be based on the specific aspects of the systems components, development approach, and production and operations processes.
```

```capability
System Capabilities are another aspect of the value of the system and tie to the stakeholder’s preferences as well. These system capabilities can also be used to assess the system’s ability to perform various applications (or support various design reference missions). This assessment provides an indication of the system’s robustness.
