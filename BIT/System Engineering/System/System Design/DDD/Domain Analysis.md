Domain analysis involves systematically studying and analysing the characteristics, requirements, and constraints of a specific application domain.
It aims to identify the commonalities, variability, and [[Core Assets]] within the domain.
Domain analysis involves activities such as domain modelling, domain knowledge acquisition, identification of domain-specific requirements, and identification of reusable components and architectures. 
The goal is to build a deep understanding of the domain and to leverage this knowledge for efficient and effective software development.
