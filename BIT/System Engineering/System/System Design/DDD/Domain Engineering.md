Domain engineering, also known as product line engineering, is a systematic approach to developing software systems within a specific application domain. It aims to capture and leverage commonalities and variability across a family of related software systems.

Focus  on understanding and modelling the common features, functionalities, and requirements that are shared across multiple software systems within a specific domain. This involves identifying the core assets, commonalities, and variability within the domain and creating reusable components, frameworks, and architectures that can be used to develop multiple products.

Domain engineering helps in reducing development time, cost, and effort by reusing domain-specific components and leveraging existing knowledge and expertise within the domain. It provides a systematic way of building software systems that are tailored to the specific needs and requirements of a particular application domain.
