Usability Measures: Usability measures are quantitative or qualitative metrics that are used to evaluate the usability of a product or system. These measures can be collected through various methods such as user testing, surveys, observations, and expert evaluations. Usability measures can include:
- Efficiency: Measures how quickly users can accomplish tasks and goals using the system.
- Effectiveness: Measures how accurately and successfully users can complete tasks and achieve their goals.
- Learnability: Measures how easy it is for users to learn and understand how to use the system.
- Error rate: Measures the frequency and severity of user errors while interacting with the system.
- Satisfaction: Measures the subjective satisfaction or user feedback regarding the system's usability.

By collecting and analyzing these usability measures, designers and researchers can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of a design and make informed decisions to improve its usability.
