Usability Matrices: Usability matrices, also known as usability evaluation matrices or usability scorecards, provide a structured framework for assessing and comparing the usability of different designs or design iterations. They typically consist of a set of usability criteria or dimensions that are evaluated and rated for each design. Usability matrices can be customized based on the specific goals and requirements of the project, but some common criteria include:

- Ease of use
- Task efficiency
- Error prevention and recovery
- Learnability
- User satisfaction
- Navigation and information architecture
- Visual design and aesthetics (ကြည့်ကောင်းတာ လှတာ)

For each criterion, a rating or score is assigned to indicate the level of usability achieved by the design. These ratings can be based on empirical data collected through user testing or expert evaluations, or they can be subjective judgments made by usability experts. Usability matrices allow for a systematic and comparative analysis of different designs, helping to prioritize design improvements and make data-driven decisions in the design process.
