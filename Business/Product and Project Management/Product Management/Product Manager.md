In some cases, product management for one product, or family of products, is handled by a single Product Manager. 
This individual must represent a deep proficiency in at least one of the areas that touch product management, and a passion for or fluency in the others.
This most often manifests itself in one of two cases: 
	- An experienced business marketer with a passion for outstanding user experience and can speak fluent tech lingo, 
	- A technical development leader who understands the product so well that they can begin to drive its creation. 
These people have proven to be so rare and valuable that product management now commands the highest salaries in all of tech.

- Chief Product Officer (CPO) - Leads the product function at an organizational level. Ensures each product is looked after by skilled PMs and their teams.
- Product Owner - Takes a more active role in the development of the product by managing the engineering team’s backlog and their communication with other stakeholders.
- Product Marketing Manager (PMM) - Improves the product team's ability to reach customers and learn from them through product-tailored marketing campaigns and the insights they provide.
- User Experience ([[UX]]) Researcher - UX is one of a PM’s core responsibilities, but a dedicated UX researcher, who studies user behavior and makes usability recommendations, is a great addition to any product team.
