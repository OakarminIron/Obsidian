`ITSM` combines `ITSM` principles with Agile practices to enhance responsiveness and customer satisfaction. It involves adapting Agile concepts like iterative development, customer collaboration, and continuous improvement to IT service management.

`**Agile ITSM**` takes a broader approach by integrating Agile practices not only into service management but also into various IT processes, functions, and interactions. It's about fostering an Agile culture across the entire IT organization to achieve more efficient and customer-focused service delivery. 
While Agile Service Management mainly applies Agile principles to `ITSM` processes, Agile `ITSM` encompasses a wider range of IT functions, including development, operations, project management, and more.

1. **Holistic Agility**: Applying Agile principles to various IT processes beyond just service management.

3. **Cross-Functional Teams**: Encouraging collaboration between different IT functions for seamless service delivery.
4. **Lean Thinking**: Incorporating Lean principles to eliminate waste and optimize processes.
