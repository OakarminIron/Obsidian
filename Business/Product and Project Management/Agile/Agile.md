One of the core concepts in [[Agile]] is that the scope of a project is fluid, while resources stay the same. As such, in agile product management the team spends less time defining the product before hand, and is open to changes along the way. The product comes together one iteration at a time, allowing for customer data and team retrospectives to drive the next stage. As such, agile product management is more about guiding the development team through cycles, while maintaining the product vision and integrating customer insight along the way.
