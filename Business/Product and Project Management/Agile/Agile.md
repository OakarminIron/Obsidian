Agile is a specific approach to management and  development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress.
The Agile methodology was developed as a response to traditional, rigid project management methods that struggled to keep up with the rapidly changing nature of  development. 

The Agile methodology is based on the Agile Manifesto, which outlines a set of guiding values and principles, including:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.
