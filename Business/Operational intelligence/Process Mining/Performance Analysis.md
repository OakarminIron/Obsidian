Used when there is an _a priori_ model. The model is extended with additional performance information such as processing times, cycle times, waiting times, costs, etc., so that the goal is _not_ to check conformance, but rather to improve the performance of the existing model with respect to certain process performance measures. An example is the extension of a process model with performance data, i.e., some prior process model dynamically annotated with performance data. It is also possible to extend process models with additional information such as decision rules and organisational information (e.g., roles).
