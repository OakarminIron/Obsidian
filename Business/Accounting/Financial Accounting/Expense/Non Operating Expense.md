- Legal Fees for a Lawsuit: If your business is involved in a legal dispute and you incur legal fees, these are typically categorized as non-operating expenses. They are considered unusual and not part of regular business operations.
- Impairment Loss on an Asset: If your business has an asset (like a piece of equipment) that has lost value and you record an impairment loss, this is a non-operating expense. It's not an ordinary expense related to business operations.
- One-Time Tax Penalties: If your business incurs non-recurring tax penalties or fines that are not part of your regular tax liabilities, these are classified as non-operating expenses.
- Losses from the Sale of Investments: If your business sells investments (such as stocks or bonds) at a loss, these losses are considered non-operating expenses because they're related to financial activities outside the core business operations.
