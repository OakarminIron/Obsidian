အမှန်ရငွေ ပေးငွေစာရင်းကိုင်မှတ်တမ်း
Cash accounting is an accounting method where payment receipts are recorded during the period in which they are received, and expenses are recorded in the period in which they are actually paid. In other words, revenues and expenses are recorded when cash is received and paid, respectively.  ငွေတကယ် ရ ပေးရတဲ့ အချိန်မှ မှတ်တဲ့ ပုံစံ

A main drawback of cash accounting is that it may not provide an accurate picture of the liabilities that have been incurred (i.e. accrued) but not yet paid for, so that the business might appear to be better off than it really is.
