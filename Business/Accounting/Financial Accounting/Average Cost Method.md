Average cost method, also called weighted-average method, is a way to assign costs to inventory items:

Calculate the average cost by dividing the total cost of goods purchased or produced in a period by the total number of items acquired.
This method uses the weighted average of all inventory items bought during a period to determine the cost of goods sold (COGS) and the cost of remaining items for sale.
Consistency in inventory valuation methods is crucial for accounting compliance.
Formula: `Average Cost for Period = Total Cost of Goods Purchased or Produced in Period รท Total Number of Items Purchased or Produced in Period.`

Product pricing is standardized, using a default method called standard price if no costing method is chosen. Stock movements and purchase orders don't impact product cost; users establish a standard price for a product by creating a product category.

| ---------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
|            | Quantity | Purchase Price | Stock Value      | Unit Cost  |
| Po001      | +10      | $5             | 10*5=$50          | 50/10=$5   |
| Po002      | +10      | $15            | 10*15=$150        | 200/20=$10 |
| WH/OUT/001 | -15      |                | 200-(10*15)=$150 | 50/5=$10   |

We purchased ten units of a product with a $5 purchase price in the first purchase order shown in the above table. 
In that situation, the Stock value is $50, and the Unit Cost is $5. 
The quantity in the second purchase order is the same as the first one, and the purchase price increased to $15.
So, the stock value is $150 for a second purchase order. 
But, we consider the stock value for unit cost as $200, which is a sum of the first and second purchase order stock value (150+50).
Hence, the unit cost for a second purchase order is $10.

## Benefits of Average Cost Method

Average cost method requires minimal labor to apply and is, therefore, the least expensive of all the methods.
In addition to the simplicity of applying average cost method, income cannot be as easily manipulated as other inventory-costing methods.

Companies that sell products that are indistinguishable from each other or that find it difficult to find the cost associated with individual units will prefer to use average cost method. This also helps when there are large volumes of similar items moving through inventory, making it time-consuming to track each individual item.
