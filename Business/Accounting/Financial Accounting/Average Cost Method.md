## Benefits of Average Cost Method

Average cost method requires minimal labor to apply and is, therefore, the least expensive of all the methods. In addition to the simplicity of applying average cost method, income cannot be as easily manipulated as other inventory-costing methods. Companies that sell products that are indistinguishable from each other or that find it difficult to find the cost associated with individual units will prefer to use average cost method. This also helps when there are large volumes of similar items moving through inventory, making it time-consuming to track each individual item.
