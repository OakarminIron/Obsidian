Using the indirect method, net income is adjusted to a cash basis using changes in non-cash accounts, such as [[Depreciation]], [[Odoo Account Receivable]], [[Odoo Account Payable]], and accounts payable (AP). Because most companies report the net income on an accrual basis, it includes various non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization.

The calculation for OCF using the indirect method uses the following formula:

**OCF = NI + D&A - NWC**

Where NI represents the company's [[Net Income]], D&A represents [[Depreciation]] and [[Amortization]], and [[NWC (Working Capital)]] is the increase in net working capital.

Net Income must also be adjusted for changes in working capital accounts on the company's balance sheet. For example, an increase in AR indicates that revenue was earned and reported in Net Income on an accrual basis although cash has not been received. This increase in AR must be subtracted from net income to find the true cash impact of the transactions.

Conversely, an increase in AP indicates that expenses were incurred and booked on an accrual basis that has not yet been paid. This increase in AP would need to be added back to net income to find the true cash impact.

Consider a manufacturing company that reports a net income of $100 million, while its operating cash flow is $150 million. The difference results from a depreciation expense of $150 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $50 million, and a decrease in accounts payable of $50 million. It would appear on the operating cash flow section of the cash flow statement in this manner:
