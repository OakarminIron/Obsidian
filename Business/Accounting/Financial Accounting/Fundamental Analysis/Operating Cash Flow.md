Using the indirect method, net income is adjusted to a cash basis using changes in non-cash accounts. 
Because most companies report the net income on an accrual basis, it includes various non-cash items, such as [[Depreciation]] and [[Amortisation]].

```
OCF = NI + D&A - NWC

NI = Net Income 
D&A represents Depreciation and Amortisation
Net Working Capital.

 Direct method, in which a company records all transactions on a cash basis and displays the information using actual cash inflows and outflows during the accounting period. Examples of items included in the presentation of the direct method of operating cash flow include:
-   Salaries paid out to employees
-   Cash paid to vendors and suppliers
-   Cash collected from customers
-   Interest income and dividends received
-   Income tax paid and interest paid

This method is simpler than the indirect method because there are fewer factors to consider. 
However, it only accounts for cash revenues and expenses. 

``OCF = Cash Revenue — Operating Expenses Paid in Cash``
