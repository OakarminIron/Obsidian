Working capital, also known as net working capital (NWC), is the difference between a company’s [[Current Assets]]—such as cash, accounts receivable/customers’ unpaid bills, and inventories of raw materials and finished goods—and its [[Short-term Liabilities]], such as accounts payable and debts. It's a commonly used measurement to gauge the short-term health of an organization.

-   Working capital, also called net working capital, represents the difference between a company’s current assets and current liabilities.
-   Working capital is a measure of a company’s liquidity and short-term financial health.
-   A company has negative working if its ratio of current assets to liabilities is less than one (or if it has more current liabilities than current assets).
-   Positive working capital indicates that a company can fund its current operations and invest in future activities and growth.
-   High working capital isn’t always a good thing. It might indicate that the business has too much inventory, not investing its excess cash, or not capitalizing on low-expense debt opportunities.
