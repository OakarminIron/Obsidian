- A profitability ratio that compares a company’s operating income to sales.
- Operating income is earnings before interest and taxes [[EBIT]].
- Operating margin indicates how successful management has been in generating income from operating the business.
- The calculation is sales less cost of goods sold and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) costs divided by sales.
- Trends in operating margin—positive or negative—are, for the most part, directly tied to management decisions. 
- Companies with higher operating margins relative to their peers might possibly have more effective price controls, or they might be growing sales more than operating costs.
- Among analysts, operating margin is often considered a more valid or reliable profitability measure than net profit margin, as operating income tends to be more difficult to manipulate than net earnings.
