-   `Net Income / average shareholder’s Equity🍕`
- Return on equity is the level of income attributed to shareholders against the investment that shareholders put into the firm.
- It takes into account the amount of debt, or financial leverage, a firm uses.
- Financial leverage magnifies the impact of earnings on ROE in both good and bad years.
- Generally, the higher the ROE the better, 
	- but beware of a company that generates a **high ROE by using debt** that is excluded from the denominator.
