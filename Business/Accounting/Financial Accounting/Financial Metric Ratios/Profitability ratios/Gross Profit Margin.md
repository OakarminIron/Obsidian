Gross profit is a key financial metric that reflects a company's profitability after accounting for the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Here are some key points:
- **Definition**: Gross profit is the profit a company earns from its core operational activities, specifically the sale of products or services.
- **COGS Explanation**: 
	- The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) represents the direct costs associated with producing or delivering those products or services. 
	- It includes expenses related to labor, raw materials, and manufacturing overhead used in the production process.
- **Calculation**: The formula is: `Gross Profit = Total Sales Revenue - COGS`.
- **Margin Ratio**: The gross profit margin is a vital financial ratio that measures how efficiently a company utilizes labor and raw materials in the production process. It's calculated as (Gross Profit / Total Sales) * 100. This ratio helps assess profitability relative to revenue.
- **Usage of Gross Profit**: Companies use their gross profit to support various activities, including research and development, marketing, and other endeavors crucial for generating future sales and growth.
- **Warning Sign**: A consistent decrease in the gross profit margin can be a red flag, suggesting potential challenges in maintaining sales and overall profitability.
- **Disclosure**: It's important to note that not all companies disclose their Cost of Goods Sold on their income statements. Some service-related and financial companies may not provide this information, making it impossible to calculate their gross profit margin using the formula.
