Liquidity ratios provide investors with an idea of a company’s operational efficiency and how well they can repay their debts with available, generated Capital. A few examples of liquidity ratios include:

- [[Current Ratio]]
- [[Cash Ratio]]
- [[Quick Ratio (ACID Test)]]

Marketable Securities are assets that can be liquidated to cash quickly. 
Although this ratio is generally considered the most conservative liquidity ratio and is very reliable, it is possible that even short-term marketable securities can experience a significant drop in prices during market crises.
