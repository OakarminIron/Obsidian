- A liquidity ratio for a firm that measures its current assets against its current liabilities. 
- The current ratio indicates if the company can pay off its short-term liabilities in an emergency by liquidating its current assets. 
- Current assets are found at the top of the balance sheet and include line items such as 
	- cash and cash equivalents
	- accounts receivable and
	- inventory, among others. 
- A low current ratio indicates that a firm may have a hard time paying their current liabilities in the short run and deserves further investigation. 
- A high ratio indicates a high level of liquidity and less chance of a cash squeeze. 
- A current ratio that is too high, however, may indicate that the company is carrying too much inventory.
