-   A coverage ratio, broadly, is a measure of a company's ability to service its debt and meet its financial obligations.
-   The higher the coverage ratio, the easier it should be to make interest payments on its debt or pay dividends.
-   Coverage ratios come in several forms and can be used to help identify companies in a potentially troubled financial situation.
-   Common coverage ratios include the interest coverage ratio, debt service coverage ratio, and asset coverage ratio.


- Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT / Interest Expense
- Debt Service Coverage Ratio = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service
- Asset Coverage Ratio = Total Assets - Short-term Liabilities / Total Debt
	where:
	Total Assets = Tangibles, such as land, buildings, machinery, and inventory


-   The fixed-charge coverage ratio measures a firm's ability to cover its fixed charges, such as debt payments, interest expense, and equipment lease expense. It shows how well a company's earnings can cover its fixed expenses. Banks often look at this ratio when evaluating whether to lend money to a business.
-   The loan life coverage ratio (LLCR) is a financial ratio used to estimate the solvency of a firm, or the ability of a borrowing company to repay an outstanding loan. The LLCR is calculated by dividing the net present value (NPV) of the money available for debt repayment by the amount of outstanding debt. 
-   The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is a ratio that is used to assess a company's financial durability by examining whether it is at least profitable enough to pay off its interest expenses.
-   The preferred dividend coverage ratio is a coverage ratio that measures a company's ability to pay off its required preferred dividend payments. Preferred dividend payments are the scheduled dividend payments that are required to be paid on the company's preferred stock shares. Unlike common stock shares, the dividend payments for preferred stock are set in advance and cannot be changed from quarter to quarter. The company is required to pay them.
-   The liquidity coverage ratio(LCR) refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets held by financial institutions to ensure their ongoing ability to meet short-term obligations. This ratio is essentially a generic stress test that aims to anticipate market-wide shocks and make sure that financial institutions possess suitable capital preservation, to ride out any short-term liquidity disruptions that may plague the market.
-   The capital loss coverage ratio is the difference between an asset’s book value and the amount received from a sale relative to the value of the nonperforming assets being liquidated. The capital loss coverage ratio is an expression of how much transaction assistance is provided by a regulatory body in order to have an outside investor take part.
