This ratio is used by investors to determine a stock's potential for growth. 
It reflects how much they would pay to receive $1 of earnings. 
It's often used to compare the potential value of a selection of stocks.

`company's current stock price / earnings-per-share.`

If  
	a company closed trading at $46.51 a share 
	and the Earnings per Share (`EPS`) for the past 12 months averaged $4.90
then 
	the P/E ratio would be 9.49 ($46.51/$4.90). 

Investors would spend $9.49 for every generated dollar of annual earnings. 
Investors have been willing to pay more than 20 times the `EPS` for certain stocks 
	when they've felt that a future growth in earnings will give them an adequate return on their investment.

If a company has zero or negative earnings, the P/E ratio will no longer make sense.
