Earning Before Interest Taxes
- (`EBITA`) removes the 
	taxes owed
	the interest on company debt
	and the effects of amortization, 
which is the accounting practice of writing off the cost of an intangible asset over a period of years, from the earnings equation.
- This measure can provide a more accurate view of a company’s value.
- `EBITA` may also allow for easier comparison of one company to another in the same industry.
- `EBITA` can be misleading as a valuation method because it excludes certain expenses from earnings.

Some analysts consider both `EBITA` and [[EBITDA]] to be reliable indicators of a company’s [[Cash Flows Statement]]. 
However, you should consider these metrics carefully, because they tend to overstate a business's cash flow.
