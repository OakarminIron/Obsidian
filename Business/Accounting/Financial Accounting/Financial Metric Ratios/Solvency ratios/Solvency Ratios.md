Solvency ratios analyze how well a company can deal with its long-term financial obligations such as debt and interest. 
Overall, solvency ratios focus on how sufficient a companyâ€™s cash flow situation is and how long it can maintain that sufficiency. 
Examples of solvency ratios are:
	- [[(Debt Ratio) debt-to-assets]]
