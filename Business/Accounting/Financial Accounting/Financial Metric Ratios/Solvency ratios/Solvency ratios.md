Solvency ratios analyze how well a company can deal with its long-term financial obligations such as debt and interest. Overall, solvency ratios focus on how sufficient a companyâ€™s cash flow situation is and how long it can maintain that sufficiency. Examples of solvency ratios are:

- [[Debt-to-assets ratio (debt ratio)]]
- [[Debt-to-equity (DE ratio)]]
- [[Interest coverage ratio (interest earned)]]
