- The debt (or LiabilitiesðŸ’¸)-to-AssetsðŸ’° ratio measures a companyâ€™s use of leverage: 
- It tells you the percentage of debt used to finance assets, which can include both tangible (property, plant and equipment) and intangible (patents and trademarks) resources.
- On the liability side, this ratio normally includes both short- and long-term debt. 
- The formula is total liabilities divided by total assets. 
- A lower debt ratio indicates that a company relies less on borrowing as compared to equity for financing its assets. 
- Generally, the lower the debt-to-assets ratio the better, but acceptable levels will vary across industries and companies.
- Larger, stable and more established companies can take on more debt without adding too much risk for investors. 
- The more predictable and stable the cash flow, the easier and cheaper it is for firms to borrow. 
- Companies in more volatile industries (like technology) may have a harder time adding debt if times get rocky.
