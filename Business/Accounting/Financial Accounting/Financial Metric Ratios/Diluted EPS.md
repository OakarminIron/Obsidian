Diluted `EPS` is a measurement used to gauge the quality of a company's earnings per share (`EPS`) if all convertible securities were exercised. 
The diluted `EPS` is commonly lower than the simple or basic `EPS`.



`EPS` is reported on a company's income statement, and only public companies are required to include it in their earnings reports. 
Public companies report both primary and diluted `EPS`, but the focus is often on the conservative diluted `EPS` measurement.

`Dilutive EPS `indicates a worst-case scenario for earnings per share and reflects the consequence of all `dilutive` shares such as options, warrants, and convertible preferred shares, converted simultaneously.
