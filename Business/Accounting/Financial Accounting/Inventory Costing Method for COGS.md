[[FIFO]]
The earliest goods to be purchased or manufactured are sold first. Since prices tend to go up over time, a company that uses the FIFO method will sell its least expensive products first, which translates to a lower COGS than the COGS recorded under LIFO. Hence, the net income using the FIFO method increases over time.

A real-time value is available for current stock with reports in a First in First Out(FIFO) costing method. It provides outgoing stock balance, incoming stock balance, and ending stock. With the FIFO costing method, users can add a landed cost easily. The price will compute on the product field when we remove a product from the warehouse. Let’s see how FIFO works by viewing an example in the table below.

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
||Quantity|Purchase Price|Stock Value|Unit Cost|
|PO001|+10|$5|10*5=$50|50/10=$5|
|PO002|+10|$15|10*15=$150|200/20=$10|
|WH/OUT/001|-15||(10*5)+(5*15)=$125|125/15=$8.33|
||||200-125=$75|75/5=$15|


[[LIFO]]
LIFO is where the latest goods added to the inventory are sold first. During periods of rising prices, goods with higher costs are sold first, leading to a higher COGS amount. Over time, the net income tends to decrease.

[[Average Cost Method]] (see details)
The average price of all the goods in stock, regardless of purchase date, is used to value the goods sold. Taking the average product cost over a time period has a smoothing effect that prevents COGS from being highly impacted by the extreme costs of one or more acquisitions or purchases.

[[Special Identification Method]]
The special identification method uses the specific cost of each unit of merchandise (also called inventory or goods) to calculate the ending inventory and COGS for each period. In this method, a business knows precisely which item was sold and the exact cost. Further, this method is typically used in industries that sell unique items like cars, real estate, and rare and precious jewels.
