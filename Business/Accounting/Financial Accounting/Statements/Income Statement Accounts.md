[[Income Statement Accounts]]
Income statement accounts, also known as profit and loss (P&L) accounts, represent a company's financial performance over a period of time (e.g., a month, quarter, or year). They include:
	a. Revenue or Income: Accounts related to the company's earnings from its primary operations. For example, sales revenue, service revenue, or interest income.
	b. Expenses: Accounts related to the costs incurred in generating revenue. Expenses can include items like salaries, rent, utilities, and depreciation.

Income statement accounts are listed after the balance sheet accounts in the `COA` because they represent the results of the company's operations.
The net income or loss calculated from these accounts is transferred to the equity section of the balance sheet.

The order of income statement accounts may vary depending on the specific `COA` structure, but they are typically organized in a logical sequence, with revenue accounts listed before expense accounts. 

This sequence allows for the calculation of gross profit (revenue minus cost of goods sold) and operating income (gross profit minus operating expenses).
