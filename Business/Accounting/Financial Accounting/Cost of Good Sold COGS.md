Cost of goods sold (COGS) refers to the direct costs of producing the goods sold by a company. 
This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. 
It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.

``` COGS=Beginning Inventory + Purchases during the period​ − Ending Inventory ```


-   Cost of goods sold (COGS) includes all of the costs and expenses directly related to the production of goods.
-   COGS excludes indirect costs such as overhead and sales & marketing.
-   COGS is deducted from revenues (sales) in order to calculate gross profit and gross margin. Higher COGS results in lower margins.
-   The value of COGS will change depending on the accounting standards used in the calculation.
-   COGS differs from operating expenses (`OPEX`) in that `OPEX` includes expenditures that are not directly tied to the production of goods or services.
