- Three-Tier Format
	In the three-tier `COA` structure, accounts are categorized into three main sections
	However, within these sections, there are multiple subcategories or levels. 
	For example:
		a. Assets: This category can be divided into current assets (e.g., cash, accounts receivable) and non-current assets (e.g., property, plant, equipment).
		b. Liabilities: Liabilities can be categorized as current liabilities (e.g., accounts payable) and long-term liabilities (e.g., bonds payable).
		c. Equity: Equity accounts can be broken down into different types of equity, such as common stock, retained earnings, and additional paid-in capital.
	This format offers more granularity within each major category, making it useful for larger organizations with complex financial reporting requirements.

- Four-Tier Format:
	A four-tier `COA` structure takes the three-tier structure a step further by introducing additional levels of detail. 
	For example:
		a. Assets: Under current assets, you might have subcategories like cash, accounts receivable, and inventory.
		b. Liabilities: In this section, you could categorize current liabilities into accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and short-term debt.

- Function-Based `COA`:
	Some organizations opt for a function-based `COA` where accounts are structured based on their functions within the business rather than following traditional balance sheet and income statement categories.
	Accounts are organized according to how they relate to specific business processes or departments. For instance, you might have accounts for marketing expenses, production costs, or sales revenue.
	This format can be helpful for companies that want to align their financial reporting with their operational structure and decision-making processes.

Project or Departmental `COA`:
	In a project or departmental `COA`, accounts are organized around specific projects, divisions, or departments within the organization.
	Each project or department may have its own set of accounts, allowing for separate financial tracking and reporting.
	This structure is particularly useful for organizations with multiple business units or projects that require independent financial management.
