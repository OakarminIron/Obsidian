- Equity is like your slice of the pizza in a company, showing how much of it you own. It's a way to measure your interest and investment in that business.
- Equity reflects the net assets of the company that belong to its owners.

- Ownership: Equity represents your share of a company. If you own shares in a company, you have equity in that business.
- Components: Equity can be divided into parts, like shares of stock you own or money you've invested in the company.
	- Common Stock: The total value of shares issued to shareholders in exchange for ownership in the company.
	- Retained Earnings: The accumulated profits or losses generated by the company since its inception, minus any dividends paid to shareholders.
	- Additional Paid-in Capital (`APIC`): The amount of capital raised by the company through the issuance of shares that exceeds the par or stated value of those shares.
	- Treasury Stock: The amount of the company's own stock that it has repurchased from shareholders.
- Changes: Equity can go up when the company makes a profit, or down if it loses money. If you get paid dividends or sell your shares, your equity changes too.
