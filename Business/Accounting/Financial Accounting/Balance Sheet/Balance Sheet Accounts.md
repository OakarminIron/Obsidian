Balance sheet accounts represent a company's financial position at a specific point in time. 
They are categorized into two main sections:
	a. Assets: Assets are what a company owns. They include items like cash, accounts receivable, inventory, buildings, and equipment.
	b. Liabilities: Liabilities are what a company owes. They include items like accounts payable, loans, and bonds payable.
	c. Equity: Equity represents the ownership interest in the company and is calculated as assets minus liabilities. It includes common stock, retained earnings, and additional paid-in capital.

Within each of these categories, accounts are typically organized in order of liquidity. This means that the most liquid assets (e.g., cash) are listed first, followed by less liquid assets (e.g., accounts receivable), and so on. Liabilities are also typically listed in order of maturity, with short-term liabilities listed before long-term ones.

The balance sheet accounts in the `COA` provide a snapshot of the company's financial health at a given moment and are used to create the balance sheet financial statement.
