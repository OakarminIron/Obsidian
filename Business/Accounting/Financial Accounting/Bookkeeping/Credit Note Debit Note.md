If any mistakes occur in an invoice, delivered goods, services, or payments, you can generate credit notes for your customers. You can generate credit notes for reversing both invoice and bill. 
Purpose: A credit note is issued when there is a decrease in the amount payable by a buyer to a seller.
It is essentially a document that acknowledges a reduction in the amount owed.

Common Scenarios: 
	Goods Accepted for Return: When a buyer returns goods and is entitled to a refund, a credit note is issued to adjust the amount payable.
	Discounts: If a seller agrees to provide a discount or rebate to a buyer after the initial invoice has been issued, a credit note may be used to reflect the reduced amount payable.


Debit Note
Purpose: A debit note is issued when there is an increase in the amount payable by a buyer to a seller. It is essentially a document that serves as a formal request for a credit note.
Common Scenarios:
	Goods Returned: If the buyer returns defective or damaged goods, the seller may issue a debit note to acknowledge the return and adjust the amount payable by the buyer.
	Over-billing: If there was an error in the original invoice and the buyer was overcharged, a debit note may be issued to correct the mistake.
