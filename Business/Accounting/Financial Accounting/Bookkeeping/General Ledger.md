The general ledger is a comprehensive and centralized accounting record that contains individual accounts from the chart of accounts.
It's essentially a detailed record of all financial transactions, with each account in the chart of accounts having its own section in the general ledger. 
The general ledger is where all transactions are posted and recorded over time, and it maintains the balances and histories of individual accounts. 
It provides a summarized view of account balances and activities.
