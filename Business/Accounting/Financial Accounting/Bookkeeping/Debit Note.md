Purpose: A debit note is issued when there is an increase in the amount payable by a buyer to a seller. It is essentially a document that serves as a formal request for a credit note.
Common Scenarios:
Goods Returned: If the buyer returns defective or damaged goods, the seller may issue a debit note to acknowledge the return and adjust the amount payable by the buyer.
Overbilling: If there was an error in the original invoice and the buyer was overcharged, a debit note may be issued to correct the mistake.
