Purpose: A credit note is issued when there is a decrease in the amount payable by a buyer to a seller. It is essentially a document that acknowledges a reduction in the amount owed.

Common Scenarios:
Goods Accepted for Return: When a buyer returns goods and is entitled to a refund, a credit note is issued to adjust the amount payable.
Discounts: If a seller agrees to provide a discount or rebate to a buyer after the initial invoice has been issued, a credit note may be used to reflect the reduced amount payable.
