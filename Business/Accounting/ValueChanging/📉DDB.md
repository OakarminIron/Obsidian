Double Declining Balance Depreciation

Method: This is an aggressive form of declining balance depreciation where the asset's depreciation rate is twice that of straight-line depreciation.
Formula: Depreciation Expense = (2 x Straight-Line Depreciation Rate) x Book Value at the Beginning of the Year
Usage: Double declining balance depreciation is used when an asset is expected to lose value quickly in its early years.
