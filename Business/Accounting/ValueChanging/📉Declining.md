 Declining Balance ,also known as Accelerated Depreciation

- Method: With this method, a higher depreciation expense is recognised in the earlier years of an asset's life, and it decreases in subsequent years.
- Formula: Depreciation Expense = (Book Value at the Beginning of the Year x Depreciation Rate)
- Depreciation Rate: Typically expressed as a percentage, it is often twice the straight-line rate.
- Usage: Declining balance depreciation reflects the idea that assets tend to lose value more rapidly in their early years of use. It can better match the expense with the asset's actual wear and tear.
