Amortization is the accounting practice of spreading the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life. 
Intangible assets are not physical in nature but they are, nonetheless, assets of value.

Amortization is typically expended on a straight-line basis. 
That means that the same amount is expended in each period over the asset's useful life. 
Assets that are expended using the amortization method typically don't have any resale or salvage value.

The term "amortization" is used in another, unrelated, context. 
An amortization schedule is often used to calculate a series of loan payments consisting of both principal and interest in each payment, as in the case of a mortgage.
