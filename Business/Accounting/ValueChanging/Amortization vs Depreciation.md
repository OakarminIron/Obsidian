[[Amortization]] and [[Depreciation]] are the two main methods of calculating the value of these assets, 
with the key difference between the two methods involving the type of asset being expended. 
In addition, there are differences in the methods allowed, components of the calculations, and how they are presented on financial statements.

By definition, depreciation is only applicable to physical, tangible assets subject to having their costs allocated over their useful lives.
Alternatively, amortization is only applicable to intangible assets. ( such as brand, customer loyalty)
