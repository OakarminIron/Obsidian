**Demurrage fees:** Shipping lines frequently charge demurrage fees for containers sitting beyond the free time allotted inside a port or terminal. These fees increase the longer the containers remain onsite.

**Port charges**: There are various port charges, so associated fees vary depending on the package’s destination. Shippers can experience early or late port charges, demurrage fees, or even cancellation costs.

**Exchange rates:** It pays in the long run to keep the fluidity of exchange rates in mind when establishing product prices. Small business owners are at the mercy of currency exchange rates.
