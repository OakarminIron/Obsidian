- Method: Under `SYD` depreciation, the asset's depreciation expense is calculated by using a fraction of the sum of the years remaining in its useful life.
- Formula: Depreciation Expense = (Remaining Useful Life / Sum of the Years' Digits) x (Cost of Asset - Accumulated Depreciation)
- Usage: `SYD` depreciation results in higher depreciation expenses in the early years and decreasing expenses in later years, similar to declining balance depreciation.
