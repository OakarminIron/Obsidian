A direct tax is levied on individuals and organisations and cannot be shifted to another payer.
Often with a direct tax, such as the personal income tax, tax rates increase as the taxpayer’s ability to pay increases, resulting in what’s called a [[Progressive Tax]].

Direct taxes include:
- [[Personal Income Tax]]
- [[Payroll Tax]]
- [[Corporate Income Tax]]
- [[Capital Gains Tax]]
- [[Estate Tax]]
- [[Property Taxes]]
