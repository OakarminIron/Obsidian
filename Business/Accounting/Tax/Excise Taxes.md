Excise taxes are taxes imposed on a specific good or activity, usually in addition to a broad consumption tax, and comprise a relatively small and volatile share of total tax collections. 
Common examples of excise taxes include those on cigarettes, alcohol, soda, gasoline, and betting.(မမိုက်ဘူးပေါ့ဗျာ)
