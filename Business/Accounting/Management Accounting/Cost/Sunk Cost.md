In economic terms, sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered.
Money already spent in the past, while opportunity cost is the potential returns not earned in the future on an investment because the capital was invested elsewhere. When considering opportunity cost, any sunk costs previously incurred are ignored unless there are specific variable outcomes related to those funds.

-   Sunk costs are those which have already been incurred and which are unrecoverable.
-   In business, sunk costs are typically not included in consideration when making future decisions, as they are seen as irrelevant to current and future budgetary concerns.
-   Sunk costs are in contrast to relevant costs, which are future costs that have yet to be incurred.
-   The sunk cost fallacy is a psychological barrier that ties people to unsuccessful endeavors simply because they've committed resources to it.
-   Examples of sunk costs include salaries, insurance, rent, nonrefundable deposits, or repairs (as long as each of those items is not recoverable).
