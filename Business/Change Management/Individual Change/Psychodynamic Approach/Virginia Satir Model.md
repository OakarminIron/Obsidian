[[Transforming idea]]


A few other important ideas  include but are not limited to the following:  

- All people are innately good and have positive Life Energy at their core.
- Human beings experience themselves through the same universal processes: feeling, thinking, doing, expecting, yearning, and connecting spiritually. 
- All people possess the necessary coping resources to face life’s challenges, though some may have yet to access these resources or may view any or all of them negatively.
- Problems stem from the ways people cope with them, not the problems themselves. In other words, the “problem” is not actually the problem. 
- Treatment should focus on health, possibilities, and hope, not on pathology and problems, and treatment should utilize Life Energy to facilitate the natural healing process.
- Everyone has the ability to change. Even if external change is restricted or limited due to factors beyond an individual’s control, internal change can still be achieved.  
- While we cannot change what happened in the past, we can change how those past events affect us in the present. By resolving past trauma we can live with more positive energy.
- People always do the best they can at any given time. Even destructive or otherwise negative behaviors serve to indicate the best coping possible at that time. 
- We are in charge of our emotions. We can choose to hold onto positive feelings which provide validation and let go of negative feelings.

According to the Satir model, the pain people experience is the result of the way they manage their perceptions, expectations, emotions, and behaviors. By focusing on three primary areas—the Intrapsychic System, the Interactive System, and the Family of Origin System—people can examine their experiences and relationships, develop goals, and work toward change.
