Research philosophy refers to the set of beliefs, assumptions, and principles that guide the researcher's approach to [[Conducting Research]]. 
It forms the foundation for the researcher's perspective on knowledge, reality, and values, and influences the methods and strategies employed in the research process. There are three key components of research philosophy: epistemology, ontology, and `axiology`.

[[Epistemology]] which accounts for the boundaries of acceptable knowledge related to any field of inquiry.
[[Ontology]] which relates to accounting for the nature of the realities for your research topic.
[[Axiology]] which is concerned about the values you have in selecting the research topic, because this will influence your results.

In summary, research philosophy encompasses the researcher's beliefs and assumptions about knowledge, reality, and values. Epistemology examines how knowledge is obtained and interpreted, ontology explores the nature of reality, and `axiology` focuses on the role of values in research. These components interact and shape the researcher's overall approach to conducting research, including the choice of research methods, data collection techniques, and interpretation of findings.
