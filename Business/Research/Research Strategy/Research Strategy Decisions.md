From the options outlined, decisions have to be taken about what is desirable ‘ and ’ what is really feasible. The reason arises from the constraints with which the research has to be conducted namely : -
• [[Access to data]]
• [[Position power]]
• [[Human Resources]]
• [[Time and time deadlines]]
• [[Cost and Budget]]
• [[Sourcing]]
• [[The Use of Third Parties]]
• [[Ethical issues]]
• [[Legal constraints]] (Data protection)
