As the term implies, this is research into behavioral response as a result of taking action. Typically this is used for organisational research into the response to some form of organisational
change.
The research can be conducted at different levels of the organisation : -
• The formulation of the change
• The introduction of the change
• The response to the introduction
• Further intervention
• Response to the intervention
• Assessment of those involved
• Assessment of those impacted
• Proposals for future initiatives as an outcome
The focus is upon the actions and how the actions have been introduced and then responded to.
The emphasis is to review the ‘ how ’ and ‘ why ’ type questions.

With Action Research, there is an on-going process of observation and diagnosis to discover more about the process of change, the researcher is usually involved with the research not only as an observer but a facilitator (or process consultant)
