Business environment refers to the external factors and conditions that surround a business and influence its operations, opportunities, and risks. Understanding the business environment is crucial for organizations as it enables them to identify and adapt to changes, make informed decisions, and develop effective strategies to achieve their objectives.

The business environment can be categorized into two main components: 
	[[Macro Environment]]
	[[Micro Environment]]

By analyzing the business environment, organizations can gain insights into the opportunities and threats that exist in the external landscape. This analysis enables businesses to make informed decisions, develop effective strategies, adapt to changing circumstances, and stay competitive in the marketplace.
