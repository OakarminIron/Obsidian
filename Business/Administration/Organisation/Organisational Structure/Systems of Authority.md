A system of authority refers to the organizational or societal structure that defines how power and control are distributed and exercised. It outlines the rules, roles, and relationships that govern who has the right to make decisions, enforce rules, and influence others within a particular context, whether it be a government, an institution, or a community.

- **Traditional Authority:** Rooted in long-standing beliefs, traditional authority is granted based on inheritance or religious beliefs. Qualifications are not essential, leading to challenges when individuals lack necessary skills. Common in `preindustrial` societies and monarchies, it can result in governance issues.
- **Rational-Legal Authority:** Found in modern democracies, rational-legal authority derives from laws and rules. Power resides in the office, allowing for a smooth transfer during crises. Rules are outlined in constitutions, ensuring an orderly transition of power.
- **Charismatic Authority:** Arising from exceptional personal qualities, charismatic authority is less stable. Upon a charismatic leader's death, authority diminishes, posing a threat to stability. To address this, leaders may designate successors or undergo transformation into traditional or rational-legal authority for enhanced stability.

**Stability and Transformation:** Weber's concept of "`routinization of charisma`" highlights the transformation of charismatic authority into traditional or rational-legal forms for increased stability. This process ensures a structured transition of authority, preventing disruptions following the demise of a charismatic leader.

In summary, traditional authority relies on tradition, rational-legal on laws, and charismatic on personal qualities. The transformation of charismatic authority enhances stability in governance.
