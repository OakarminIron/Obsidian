Procurement lead time factors all relate to the sourcing of raw materials for production. 
Well-established companies with strong relationships with suppliers may be less impacted by these factors.
Still, when relying to external companies, there is always the risk that lead time falters due to an external failure to deliver. 
Procurement lead time factors that increase lead time include:

	The company is not yet aware what raw materials they need.
	The company is slow to submit a purchase request.
	The company does not have a select supplier for a specific raw material.
	The company wishes to negotiate the price or term or the purchase.
	The company has an elaborate inspection process for delivered goods.
