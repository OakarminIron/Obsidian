Manufacturing lead time factors are relatively all controllable for a company. 
This internal-only stage of the sale process means a company may change processes, personnel, or equipment to improve or worsen lead time. 
As opposed to the other two lead time factors, a company should have almost full discretion over the manufacturing lead time factors. 
These factors that result in longer lead times include:

	The layout or location of the processing plant(s) is inefficient.
	The company has inadequate power or utility service.
	The company struggles to have sufficient and proficient laborers.
	The company is unable to efficiently transfer finished goods to its warehouse for distribution.
	The company faces government regulation impeding or slowing the manufacturing process.
	Equipment failure or required periodic maintenance slow the production process.
	The company awaits specialised or custom parts needed to manufacture a good.
	The company must rework products due to lack of quality.
