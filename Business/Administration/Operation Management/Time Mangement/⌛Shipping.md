When the finished product is sent to a customer, many factors are out of the hands of the company. 
Though the company can control how fast an item gets off the production line and onto a delivery vessel, a company is often at the whim of whatever delivery method they choose. These factors include:

	The company selecting a slower, more cost effective method of delivery.
	Natural conditions or weather impede the delivery process.
	The company fails to collect accurate remittance information and must inefficiently redirect shipment.
	The company mishandles the shipment and must prepare a more secure, safe delivery.
	External factors such as disrupted supply chain management cause broad transportation issues.
