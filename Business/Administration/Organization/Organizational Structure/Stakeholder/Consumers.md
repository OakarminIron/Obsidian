A consumer refers to an individual or entity that uses or consumes a product or service. Consumers are the end-users or beneficiaries of a product or service, and they may purchase or use it for personal or household use. In the context of marketing, consumer behavior analysis focuses on understanding the psychological, social, and economic factors that influence individuals' buying decisions and consumption patterns.
