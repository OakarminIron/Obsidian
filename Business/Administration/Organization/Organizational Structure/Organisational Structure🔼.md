Organisational structure is the systematic arrangement of human resources in an organisation so as to achieve common business objectives.
The four types of organisational structures are 
- [[ðŸ”¼Functional]] This is also referred to as a Bureaucratic organisational structure and breaks up a company based on the specialisation of its workforce. Most small-to-medium-sized businesses implement a functional structure. Dividing the firm into departments consisting of marketing, sales, and operations is the act of using a bureaucratic organisational structure.
- [[ðŸ”¼Multi-Divisional]] Among large companies with many business units. Called the divisional or multi-divisional (M-Form) structure, a company that uses this method structures its leadership team based on the products, projects, or subsidiaries they operate.
- [[ðŸ”¼Team-Based]] Similar to divisional or functional structures, team-based organisations segregate into close-knit teams of employees that serve particular goals and functions, but where each team is a unit that contains both leaders and workers.
- [[ðŸ”¼Flat]] Also known as a horizontal structure, is relatively newer, and is used among many startups. As the name alludes, it flattens the hierarchy and chain of command and gives its employees a lot of autonomy. Companies that use this type of structure have a high speed of implementation.
- [[ðŸ”¼Matrix]] Firms can also have a matrix structure. It is also the most confusing and the least used. This structure matrices employees across different superiors, divisions, or departments. An employee working for a matrix-ed company, for example, may have duties in both sales and customer service.
- [[ðŸ”¼Circular]] structures are hierarchical, but they are said to be circular as it places higher-level employees and managers at the centre of the organisation with concentric rings expanding outward, which contain lower-level employees and staff. This way of organising is intended to encourage open communication and collaboration among the different ranks.
- [[ðŸ”¼Network]] structure organises contractors and third-party vendors to carry out certain key functions. It features a relatively small headquarters with geographically-dispersed satellite offices, along with key functions outsourced to other firms and consultants.
