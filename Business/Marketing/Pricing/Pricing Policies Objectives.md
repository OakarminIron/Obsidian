As with many businesses, you may have objectives other than simply making money in the short-term. Your pricing policies are key tools for achieving the various goals businesses commonly have, such as:

- Profit: 
	- The most basic business objective of making profit is still an important one. 
	- For some businesses, it might be critical to maximize profit in the immediate future.
- Firm survival: 
	- Sometimes the only available pricing policy is the one that enables your firm to continue operations.
- Limiting competition: 
	- Your business may have structural advantages that enable it to produce a good at a price point no competitor can match. 
	- Businesses typically weigh the competitive consequences of any price point against profit potential.
- Gaining market share: 
	- Your pricing policy might aim at maximizing market share. 
	- Earning a large portion of market share provides both strategic and financial advantages.
- Accessibility:
	- If your company values offering its product to as many people as possible, your pricing policy might have to adapt.
- Consumer satisfaction: 
	- Consumers' expectations change depending on the price they pay for something. 
	- Your business might consider what expectations you want to meet and price accordingly.
