[[Stakeholder issues]]

Steve McConnell, in his bookÂ _Rapid Development_, details a number of ways users can inhibit requirements gathering:

-   Users do not understand what they want or users don't have a clear idea of their requirements
-   Users will not commit to a set of written requirements
-   Users insist on new requirements after the cost and schedule have been fixed
-   Communication with users is slow
-   Users often do not participate in reviews or are incapable of doing so
-   Users are technically unsophisticated
-   Users do not understand the development process
-   Users do not know about present technology

This may lead to the situation where user requirements keep changing even when system or product development has been started.

[[Engineer/developer issues]]

Possible problems caused by engineers and developers during requirements analysis are:

-   A natural inclination towards writing code can lead to implementation beginning before the requirements analysis is complete, potentially resulting in code changes to meet actual requirements once they are known.
-   Technical personnel and end-users may have different vocabularies. Consequently, they may wrongly believe they are in perfect agreement until the finished product is supplied.
-   Engineers and developers may try to make the requirements fit an existing system or model, rather than develop a system specific to the needs of the client.
