A pattern refers to a regular or recurring arrangement of elements, shapes, or colors. It is a visual structure that repeats in a predictable manner, creating a cohesive and organized design. Patterns can be found in various forms, such as textiles, wallpapers, mosaics, architecture, and even natural phenomena.

Patterns can be categorized into different types, including:

1. Geometric Patterns: These patterns are characterized by regular shapes, such as squares, triangles, circles, or hexagons. Geometric patterns often have a sense of order and [[Symmetry]].    
2. Organic Patterns: Organic patterns are inspired by nature and feature irregular, flowing, and curvi-linear shapes. They can mimic natural forms like leaves, flowers, [[waves]], or clouds, creating a more fluid and dynamic feel.    
3. Floral Patterns: Floral patterns consist of repetitive motifs of flowers, leaves, or plants. They are commonly found in textiles, wallpapers, and decorative arts.    
4. Abstract Patterns: Abstract patterns are non-representational and do not depict specific objects or figures. They often involve geometric or organic shapes arranged in a non-referential manner, creating a sense of visual interest and complexity.([[ðŸ“ŠColor Patterns]])

Patterns can be used in various ways, including as decorative elements, to add visual interest, or to create a sense of rhythm and harmony. They play a crucial role in design and can evoke different moods or communicate specific cultural or historical associations.
