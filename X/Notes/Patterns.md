A pattern refers to a regular or recurring arrangement of elements, shapes, or colors. It is a visual structure that repeats in a predictable manner, creating a cohesive and organized design. Patterns can be found in various forms, such as textiles, wallpapers, mosaics, architecture, and even natural phenomena.

Patterns can be categorized into different types, including:

1. Geometric Patterns: These patterns are characterized by regular shapes, such as squares, triangles, circles, or hexagons. Geometric patterns often have a sense of order and [[Symmetry]].    
2. Organic Patterns: Organic patterns are inspired by nature and feature irregular, flowing, and `curvi-linear` shapes. They can mimic natural forms like leaves, flowers, [[waves]], or clouds, creating a more fluid and dynamic feel.    
3. Floral Patterns: Floral patterns consist of repetitive motifs of flowers, leaves, or plants. They are commonly found in textiles, wallpapers, and decorative arts.    
4. Abstract Patterns: Abstract patterns are non-representational and do not depict specific objects or figures. They often involve geometric or organic shapes arranged in a non-referential manner, creating a sense of visual interest and complexity.([[ðŸ“ŠColor Patterns]])
5. Striped Patterns: Striped patterns feature repeated vertical or horizontal lines of varying widths and colors. They can be simple or complex, and stripes are commonly used in textiles, fashion, and interior design.    


Patterns can be used in various ways, including as decorative elements, to add visual interest, or to create a sense of rhythm and harmony. They play a crucial role in design and can evoke different moods or communicate specific cultural or historical associations.
