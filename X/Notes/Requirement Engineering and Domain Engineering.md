There can be overlap between [[Requirement Engineering]] and [[Domain Engineering]] especially when developing software systems within a specific domain. In such cases, the understanding of the domain and the knowledge of the commonalities and variability within the domain can influence the requirements engineering process.

The domain knowledge acquired during domain engineering can assist in requirements elicitation and analysis. It helps in understanding the specific needs, terminology, and constraints of the domain, which can shape the requirements gathering process. It can also guide the identification of reusable requirements and the definition of common features that are applicable across multiple systems within the domain.

In summary, requirement engineering focuses on understanding and specifying the requirements of a software system, while domain engineering focuses on leveraging the commonalities and variabilities within a specific application domain. Although they are distinct concepts, there can be overlap between them when developing software systems within a domain, where domain knowledge influences the requirements engineering process.
